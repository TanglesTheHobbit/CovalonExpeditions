Some experimentation will be in order! Finally, we'll need to find out what's at the heart of this darkness if we're to have any hope of bringing light back to Middlemist. </p>\n<hr />\n<h2 style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em);width:644.088px;font-family:var(--serif)\">Mission Overview:</h2>\n<p>While the specifics of Middlemist elude us due to the oppressive darkness, there is one thing for certain. The Seed of Terra can sense another Vessel of the Maw. We need to find out as much as we can about it and excise it from the land as soon as possible!</p>\n<p style=\"width:644.088px\">Middlemist's darkness is supernatural and acts as a fourth-level Darkness spell, except that it cannot be counteracted or counteract light effects. Instead, the range of all light sources is halved. Additionally, creatures with darkvision can see only 30 feet into Middlemist's gloom. Everything beyond that is pitch black. For creatures with greater darkvision, this range is 60 feet.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;margin-top:var(--p-space,1em);width:649.531px;font-family:var(--serif)\">How to Run an Expedition</h2>\n<p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;width:649.531px;color:#1c1c1c;font-size:15.6px\">Expeditions are composed of two subtypes: missions and finales. Missions are a set of three dungeon-like adventures that are narratively linked, but can be completed in any order. Each mission must include predetermined narrative and mechanical elements while sticking to a theme of locations, creatures, and loot, which are included in its associated journal entry, with the specifics of the blanks to be filled in by the GM of the adventure. Like other adventure types, Dungeon Guides must submit their expedition missions for approval.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;margin-top:var(--p-space,1em);width:649.531px;color:#1c1c1c;font-size:15.6px\">When reading the instructions for an expedition, you may see key terms surrounded by number signs. These indicate that the term should be replaced by a value that's dependent on the adventure's average party level.  If you have any questions about how to apply these terms or any of the required elements, be sure to ask about them during your submission for approval. Here is a list of terms:</p>\n<ul style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;padding-left:var(--space-m);width:649.531px;color:#1c1c1c;font-size:15.6px\">\n<li style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;padding-left:var(--space-s)\"><strong style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text\">#Creature [Table Number] [Modifier]#</strong> should be replaced by a value according to a table in the <a style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;margin-top:var(--p-space,1em)\" href=\"https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=995\">Building Creatures</a> section of the Gamemastery Guide. For example, \"#Creature 2-8 Minimum# means that you should reference the Building Creatures rules, look for Table 2-8, and use the value in the Minimum column for the creature's level (adjusted for elite or weak as appropriate).</li>\n<li style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;padding-left:var(--space-s)\"><strong style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text\">#Hazard [Table Number] [Modifier]# </strong>should be replaced by a value according to a table in the <a style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;margin-top:var(--p-space,1em)\" href=\"https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=1043\">Building Hazards</a> section of the Gamemastery Guide. For example, \"#Hazard 2-16 Simple Damage# means that you should reference the Building Hazards rules, look for table 2-16, and use the value in the Simple Damage column for the hazard's level.</li>\n<li style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;padding-left:var(--space-s)\"><strong style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text\">#DC [Modifier]# </strong>should be replaced by a value according to the <a style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;margin-top:var(--p-space,1em)\" href=\"https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=554\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DCs by Level</a> table in the Core Rulebook. If a modifier is included, the value should be adjusted accordingly. For example, \"#DC +5#\" means that you should reference the DCs by Level table, find the value appropriate for the party's average level, then add 5 to it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;margin-top:var(--p-space,1em);width:649.531px;color:#1c1c1c;font-size:15.6px\">Finales are singular encounters against a narratively significant threat that conclude an expedition. They come in two versions: normal mode and hard mode. Before a finale is cleared for the first time, it can only be run by Covalon administrators and moderators, and is ran at hard mode. Afterwards, the finale can be ran by any Dungeon Guide at normal mode (though players can request hard mode if they'd like). Normal mode can be run in Tier 2 or above, and hard mode can only be run at the highest tier, intended for max level characters. Unlike missions, finales use a specific map and specific creatures, included with this module.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;margin-top:var(--p-space,1em);width:649.531px;color:#1c1c1c;font-size:15.6px\">Each finale comes with three variant modifications. When running a normal mode finale, a GM choose one of the three modifications to use, or can roll <a class=\"inline-roll roll\" style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;font-family:var(--sans-serif)\" title=\"1d3\" data-mode=\"roll\" data-flavor data-formula=\"1d3\"> 1d3</a> to randomly determine which modification to use. When running a hard mode finale, the GM uses all three modifications. There are no additional rewards for completing hard mode.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;margin-top:var(--p-space,1em);width:649.531px;font-family:var(--serif)\">Reporting a Completed Expedition</h2>\n<p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;width:649.531px;color:#1c1c1c;font-size:15.6px\">When reporting a completed expedition in the Dungeon Summaries channel, use the <strong style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text\">exact name</strong> of the adventure as the adventure's title. For example, if you ran the first mission of Ikouga, the summary's title should be \"Ikouga Mission A: Retame the Island\" exactly. The summary should otherwise follow the same format as dungeons. </p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;margin-top:var(--p-space,1em);width:649.531px;color:#1c1c1c;font-size:15.6px\">Finally, any narrative-based knowledge or intrigue that the players gain as a result of the expedition should be left out of the summary. For example, if the players complete a bonus objective that allows them to learn special information as detailed in the Required Elements or Recommended Loot section of each journal entry, that should be left out of the dungeon summary.</p>"},"_id":"pp8Rhd2SutlZxrK3","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":100000,"name":"Middlemist Mission A: Delve the Dark","type":"text","_id":"a5KjNCb1FydrqZa9","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<h2>Hook</h2><p>“We have some maps of this place from before the cataclysm.  Gods know what's changed since, but maybe some towns yet stand.

Any creatures standing atop the wings when someone uses the Furl Wings activity can attempt to Grab an Edge (DC 15) to avoid falling. Climbing Kits can prevent a creature's fall, but a creature saved by a Climbing Kit dangles from the end of a 40-foot rope until it can Climb (DC15) back up the jostling line.</p><hr /><p><strong>Flash </strong>◆ (light, magical, manipulate) A crew member activates the magical lanterns lining the Red Eye’s railing with a #DC-1# Divine or Crafting check with the following effects, which last one round and are unaffected by Middlemist’s Darkness.</p><ul><li><strong>Critical Success</strong> The Red Eye’s Body sheds bright light in a 30-feet radius, with dim light for an additional 30. Creatures within the light must attempt a #DC-1# save or be dazzled</li><li><strong>Success</strong> As critical success, but the radius of each type of light is 20 feet.</li><li><strong>Failure</strong> The lights fizzle and pop, emitting dim light in a 20-foot radius.</li><li><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The lights spark dangerously. The activating creature takes #2-16 Simple Damage# fire damage with a #DC# basic Reflex save.</li></ul><p><strong>Electric Broadside </strong><span class=\"pf2-icon\"><strong>3</strong></span> (electricity, magical, manipulate) A crackling beam of energy erupts from the one side of the Red Eye’s body at an angle of the activating crew member’s choice, dealing #2-16 Complex Damage) electricity damage to all creatures in a 60-foot line (#DC+1# basic Reflex save).</p><p><strong>Furl Wings </strong><span class=\"pf2-icon\"><strong>1</strong></span> (manipulate) The Pilot can spend one action to open or close to furl the wood and canvas wings that keep the Red Eye gliding. While the Red Eye’s wings are furled, it drops by 60 feet each round and its width is reduced to 10 ft. While plummeting, the Red Eye’s body is uneven ground (#DC#)</p><h3>Midnight Flight</h3><p>The adventurers are sent on a reconnaissance mission deep into the gloom of Middlemist. Darkvision and lights except those provided by the Red Eye function the same here as elsewhere within the veil. The Red Eye’s lights stretch for their normal distance and are unobstructed by the dark.</p><p>As they near the fringes of the riven landscape at Middlemist’s center, the party is beset by flying creatures native to the darkness. This is a Moderate encounter. The Red Eye and the piloting accounts for 20xp in the encounter budget.</p><p>The creatures target the Red Eye and their drivers over their passengers, hoping to crash the ships and foil the adventurer’s quest for knowledge. </p><p>If a Red Eye becomes Broken during this encounter, the creatures wave off and the Rocky Landing Encounter begins immediately. When a vehicle is broken, it becomes harder to use. It takes a -2 penalty to its AC, saves, and collision DC, and the DC of all piloting checks related to the vehicle increase by 5. The broken vehicle’s Speeds are halved.</p><h3>Rocky Landing</h3><p>Thirty minutes after defeating the Midnight Flight encounter, bolts of dark energy strike the Red Eyes, which immediately become broken and begin to descend to the ground at dangerous speeds. The adventurers must fight to regain control of the ships as they hurtle through the air, avoiding the airborne chunks of earth thrown up by the destructive energy at Middlemist’s center.</p><p>If a Red Eye was Broken during the Midnight Flight encounter, it descends without being struck by dark energy. Either way, this encounter accounts for one-third of the adventure’s experience budget.</p><p>This encounter functions similarly to a Chase, but instead of accumulating chase points, the party must succeed at piloting check to Take Control (<span class=\"pf2-icon\">2)</span> of the Red Eyes to avoid collision damage at the end of each round. The Red Eyes become uncontrolled at the start of each round. The Red Eyes’ statistics take their normal adjustments from the Broken condition, though players can make piloting the crafts easier by Aiding or by succeeding at the Flash action, which has the following effects instead of its usual ones:</p><ul><li><strong>Critical Success</strong> The Red Eye takes a -2 circumstance penalty to its Piloting Check DC for one round.</li><li><strong>Success</strong> As success, but the circumstance penalty is -1.</li><li><strong>Failure</strong> The light is too dim to aid the descent.</li><li><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but the activating creature takes #Hazard 2-16 Complex Damage# fire damage with a #DC# basic Reflex save. </li></ul><h4>Obstacles</h4><h5>A Cloud of Pebbles (Round 1)</h5><p>Small floating stones float in pockets ahead. At speed, they’re little better than a cloud of arrows.</p><div><p><strong>Special</strong> Collisions on this obstacle do piercing damage instead of bludgeoning damage.</p></div><h5>A Storm of Energy (Round 2)</h5><p>Negative energy roils in the path ahead, bolts of it crackling back and forth in the gloom.</p><div><p><strong>Special</strong> Collisions on this obstacle do negative damage instead of bludgeoning damage.</p></div><h5>Floating Islands (Round 3)</h5><p>Large rocks, broken and jagged, list in the air ahead, leaving only narrow spaces clear ahead.</p><div><p><strong>Special</strong> If a Red Eye’s wings are furled, its piloting DC for this obstacle takes a -2 circumstance penalty. If it already had a circumstance penalty, increase it by 2.</p></div><h5>A Cloud of Creatures (Round 4)</h5><p>Winged creatures, faceless and pale, swarm directly into the Red Eyes’ paths.</p><div><p><strong>Special</strong> If a Red Eye’s wings are unfurled, its piloting DC for this obstacle receives a +2 circumstance bonus.</p></div><h5>The Rapidly Approaching Ground (Round 5)</h5><p>Barren treetops peak out of the gloom below. The ground is coming, and it’s coming quickly.</p><p><strong>Special</strong> There’s no avoiding a collision with the ground. Instead of avoiding a collision, a successful piloting check instead increases the degree of success of the Reflex saving throws of every player riding the Red Eye by one.</p><p>Adventurers with both hands free can use a single action, which has the manipulate trait to increase their degree of success on their Reflex saving throw by one. This stacks with the bonus gained from successfully Taking Control of the crashing Red Eye. Characters immediately realize dropping gear here will likely lead to its loss.</p><h3>Return</h3><p>The Red Eyes crash in a strange landscape entirely bare of plant life. Dark energy pours out from cracks in the ground, and loose stones list through the air, connected by bolts of the same foul power. The very ground is torn and broken. If the party completed the Rocky Landing encounter and succeeded at Taking Control of the vehicle on four or more of the obstacles they receive an additional 10% Investigation Bonus at the end of the session. </p><p>The adventurers must return to camp on foot. On the way, they are accosted by a band of creatures. This moderate combat encounter accounts for one-third of the experience budget.</p><h2>Recommended Locations</h2><p>Forest, the alien landscape described in the Return section.</p><h2>Recommended Creatures</h2><p>Incorporeal undead, aberrations, nocturnal animals and beasts, hags, fungi, and creatures native to the darklands, including plants that can survive in darkness. </p><p>Corporeal undead and non-outsider creatures with the Humanoid trait are not well suited to this adventure. </p><p>Creatures in the Midnight Flight encounter must have a fly speed. Creatures with the Shadow or Negative traits are particularly suited to encounters near the site of the players' crash landing.</p><h2>Recommended Loot</h2><p>The Dungeoneering Society pays the adventurers gold equal to at least 50% of the total treasure budget for flying into the dark. Treasure and magic items related to shadow, darkness, light, and negative energy can account for no more than 50% of the total treasure budget.</p><p>If the party succeed on at least 4 obstacles of the Rocky Landing encounter the party gain an additional 10% Investigation Bonus of raw gp paid by the Dungeoneering Society for rare plants that they are able to salvage. The party also learns that falling would be very dangerous and instruct the Dungeoneering Society to build harnasses on the Airship for safety! </p><p> </p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":400000,"name":"Middlemist Finale","type":"text","_id":"LHO6OfDwDgBdeijD","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<h3>Hook</h3><p>Through dedicated research and dangerous excursions, Covalon has discovered that the source of the gloom over Middlemist is the presence of a huge Shadow Titan. Not only this, but it also is the location of another Vessel of the Maw! Despite our initial victory against the creature, it continues to replenish itself from the gloom and assault the Seed of Terra. Luckily we have the Airship intact to stage another assault to keep the Seed safe! </p><p> </p><h3>The Harbinger's Flight</h3><p>In an attempt to destroy the growing sapling, the Maw has replenished and bolstered the Shadow Titan into a facsimile and sent it to destroy the Seed. Our scouts have identified that it's nearly at a critical stage of its replenishment so we need to get out there as soon as possible! Ship preparations can take quite a while, so players may only use pre-buffing spells that last 8 hours or longer. </p><p>As part of the preparations, player characters are connected to a central line on the ship via a 50ft length rope. This rope cannot be destroyed, and can be fully retracted to the centre of the ship with a single Interact action. Players can Interact with their harness even while their hands are full. </p><p>The centre of the ship contains a light emitting device that is able to cut through the incredible gloom around the Shadow Titan. The device emits 80 feet of Bright Light that is not reduced by the Middlemist gloom effects in the Middlemist Briefing. </p><p>Unless it is prevented from moving by an Obstacle, the ship moves one stage at the start of the round except the first. The total moves are: Start -&gt; Obstacle 1 -&gt; Obstacle 2 -&gt; Showdown. </p><p>The PCs begin on the Harbinger, and the Shadow Titan starts on the far right of the map with its two hands nearby. 4 Clinging Shadow monsters spring to life on the ship at the start of combat and the first sabotage occurs. </p><div data-visibility=\"gm\"><p>The Airship is a Tile asset in Foundry. If you accidentally delete it, or it breaks, you can add a new one from the Tile tool. The dimensions should be Width - 1200, Height - 1700. </p></div><h4>Sabotage</h4><p>At the start of combat, and after each time the Harbinger moves a Sabotage occurs. GMs should select a random Sabotage from the below table. <strong>If a Sabotage is not resolved within 3 rounds, the ship is damaged beyond the ability to continue battle against the Shadow Titan and the party </strong><em><strong>must</strong></em><strong> retreat.</strong> Make players aware of this information so they can appropriately prioritise when multiple effects take place at once. </p><p>When adjudicating what works to resolve a Sabotage when players attempt a creative solution, use the below action costs as a guideline but be permissive where possible. For example, a successful attempt to <em>dispel magic</em> on the Luminous Overload Sabotage should succeed, even if it's not listed as a resolution. </p><p> </p><table style=\"width:94.0146%;height:76px\" border=\"1\"><tbody><tr style=\"height:19px\"><td style=\"width:22.7101%;height:19px\"><strong>Sabotage Name</strong></td><td style=\"width:77.1369%;height:19px\"><strong> Sabotage Effect and Resolution</strong></td></tr><tr style=\"height:19px\"><td style=\"width:22.7101%;height:19px\">Hull Breaches</td><td style=\"width:77.1369%;height:19px\"><p> 4 Breaches appear on the ship as it is bombarded with Shadow bolts from the Titan. </p><p>A character who is at least Expert in Crafting or a relevant Lore may attempt to Repair the breaches with a single interact action.

Have the Titan's token placed on the front of the ship so melee attacks are able to reach it. The party must bring the Shadow Titan to 0 hp and use the central Light device as a bomb to diminish it enough to leave the Vessel vulnerable and give them time to plant the Seed. </p><p>Once the Shadow Titan is brought to 0 hp, have it stop all attacks and allow the players to narrate how they utilise the overwhelming light of the ship's central device to destroy the Titan. Some examples may be having a particularly strong character throw it into the centre of the darkness, or having it fused with ballista ammo that the players can shoot at the titan. </p><h3>Tactics Overview</h3><p>The Shadow Titan is a cold and alien creature, and is attempting to disrupt the party as much as possible from completing their objectives in the first phase of the fight. </p><p>The Hands of Darkness shoot at the party with their <strong>Shadow Rays</strong> while they close the distance. Once they arrive close to the Ship they use <strong>Umbral Wave</strong> before using their melee abilities which tend to be more disruptive. Hands focus on using <strong>Clap</strong> when it's available, and otherwise attempting to <strong>Fling</strong> players off the ship. Remember that players are tethered! </p><p>The Shadow Titan uses <strong>Bind Shadows</strong> whenever it is available, and use the players abilities against them. While this is recharging, the Titan uses <strong>Soulrending Gaze </strong>to lower players statistics and then blast them from a distance with <strong>Tenebrous Bolt</strong>, attempting to hit as many players with the Negative Splash damage as possible. </p><p>Clinging Shadows focus on Grabbing players trying to complete tasks, or stacking their <strong>Gripping Shadows</strong> passive on players by hitting them with <strong>Shadow Bolts.</strong></p><h3>Loot</h3><p>The entirety of the treasure budget is given out in raw GP, paid by the NPC used for the hook.
