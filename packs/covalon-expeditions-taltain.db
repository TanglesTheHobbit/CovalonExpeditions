{"_id":"8Y3LLnsDLD1oIQHp","name":"Taltain Mission B: Gather Information","content":"<h3>Hook</h3>\n<p>The council of Covalon is convinced that there is a Vessel of the Maw hiding out somewhere in Taltain - the problem is finding it in the massive capital. Covalon's spies have reported that the people of Taltain are amicable to conversation as long as they believe they're talking to a fellow citizen, so the adventurers are tasked with disguising themselves and talking to the citzenry directly to gather information.</p>\n<h3>Required Elements</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>During the briefing, the PCs should be informed that they will need to put together disguises for this mission. Each player will need a disguise kit (which can be purchased from the general store if the PC does not have one) and will need to roll a Deception check to Impersonate a villager. Each PC needs to make their own Deception check, but they can Follow the Expert if they are unskilled in Deception, and other players can Aid as normal. (As a reminder, regardless of the result of the PCs' Impersonate checks, NPCs only receive a chance to see through the PC's disguises if they use an action to Seek, and most NPCs should not attempt this unless they're given a reason to be suspicious of the PCs.)</li>\n<li>After the players have assumed their disguises, the players are instructed to meet with a spy in the field who will give them vital tips on how to interact with the citzenry. The spy informs the PCs that although the people of Taltain are amicable to conversation, there are a few key topics that should be avoided, as they seem to instantly raise suspicion among the citizens. When an NPC has their suspicion raised, their attitude drops to Unfriendly and they Seek the triggering PC with a Perception modifier of <strong>#DC -10#</strong>. If they see through the disguise, or if their attitude is made hostile, they will either engage the PCs in combat or call for guards if they are not fit for combat themselves. Below are topics that will raise suspicion among NPCs:\n<ul>\n<li>The Cataclysm</li>\n<li>The Maw, the Heart of the Maw, Vessels of the Maw</li>\n<li>The Heart of Terra, Covalon</li>\n<li>Aberrations disguised as people, aberrations that overthrew Taltain</li>\n<li>The wooden masks that everyone wears, questioning local customs or idioms, questioning anything that might be common knowledge to citizens</li>\n<li>Being \"new in town\"</li>\n<li>Trying to get an NPC to divulge additional information after they've already revaled one piece of objective information (keep this topic a secret from the PCs)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The spy tells the PCs that they won't be able to outright ask if there's a Vessel of the Maw in the city, or where it's being kept, but there are two things they can ask about that could prove vital to Covalon's investigation: who is in charge of the city, and where it is they congregate. The spy indicates that there are three locations that would be worth gathering investigation in: a tavern, a marketplace, and a theater. There are no mandatory combat encounters in this adventure - instead, each location's social encounter constitutes 120 XP in the XP budget, though these encounters may become combat encounters if the citizens become suspicious of the PCs. The PCs can earn one piece of objective information from each location, selected from the list in the Required Loot section. The players can visit these three locations in any order.</li>\n<li>In the tavern, players can choose to approach either the patrons or the barkeep. The patrons are rowdy and difficult to impress or get along with, and regardless of how friendly the PCs are, the patrons will eventually ask the PCs to leave them alone, leading to a bar fight if the players do not comply. The bar fight is a normal 120 XP combat encounter, except all enemies use non-lethal force. If any player makes a lethal attack, all enemies immediately switch to using lethal force instead and the barkeep calls for additional guards, which will likely overwhelm the PCs if they do not flee. Should the PCs win the bar fight nonlethally, the patrons will immediately become Friendly with the PCs and voluntarily offer up one piece of objective information to the players.</li>\n<li>If the PCs instead choose to approach the barkeep, they will find the barkeep difficult to Make an Impression with (<strong>#DC 5#</strong>)<strong>,</strong> and even more difficult to Request information from (<strong>#DC +10#</strong>), remarking that he doesn't feel like talking unless the PCs buy drinks for him and themselves. If the PCs do so, the barkeep challenges them to a drinking contest to make things more interesting. Should the PCs win, he will be open to having a conversation with them, but should they lose, they will have to buy drinks for the whole tavern. (A mug of ale is 1 copper piece, so this does not amount to a relevant cost.) The barkeep tells the PCs that they can all work together to attempt to outdrink him.\n<ul>\n<li>The first team to reach 18 Victory Points wins. </li>\n<li>Each PC rolls initiative, with the barkeep taking a turn after each PC. During their turn, a PC can perform one of three actions:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Drink!</strong> The participant drinks. The participant attempts a <strong>#DC# </strong>Fortitude save, earning 1 Victory Point on a success. When the barkeep performs this action, his modifier is <strong>#DC -5#</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>Chug! Chug! Chug! </strong>The pariticpant drinks a lot. The participant attempts a <strong>#DC +4# </strong>Fortitude save, earning 3 Victory Points on a success. The barkeep only performs this action if he is currently losing by at least 3 points, and his modifier is <strong>#DC -5#</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>Cheer On!</strong> The participant cheers on their ally. The next ally who attempts a Fortitude save during the drinking contest gains a +1 circumstance bonus to their save.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>If the PCs win the game, the bartender's attitude becomes helpful and he divulges one piece of objective information to the party. If the bartender wins the game, he and the patrons laugh the PCs out of the tavern, refusing to talk to them for having weak stomachs.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The marketplace is mostly empty. There are several merchants in stalls, but they are more interested in hawking junk than conversing with the PCs. There is one NPC interested in talking to them - a gambler on a carpet waves them over and invites them to play Swindlebones. While playing, the gambler is interested in making conversation - this is a good opportunity for the PCs to try to get information out of him. The players can also wager gold in exchange for information, but the gambler is a high stakes player, and won't be enticed by bets less than 10% of the adventure's total treasure budget. Otherwise, the gambler is happy to play without stakes. Whether through being beaten at Swindlebones or by being distracted by conversation during the game, the gambler will no longer play after revealing one piece of objective information. For information on how to play Swindlebones, see the \"Taltain Mission B Appendix: How to Play Swindlebones\" journal entry.</li>\n<li>As the PCs approach the theater, they are stopped by an NPC who mistakes the PCs as the missing actors for the show that is about to begin. The NPC attempts to hurry the players through a side door and shove them onto a stage; if the players don't comply, the NPC becomes suspicious. If the players do comply, they are immediately thrust into a scene in a play where they take on the role of six adventurers going on an adventure through a portal to find treasure to bring back home - a scenario eerily similar to the operations of the Dungeoneering Society back in Covalon. For each scene, the party must make at least one check - each success awards 1 Victory Point, a critical success earns 2 Victory Points, and a critical failure causes the party to lose 1 Victory Point.\n<ul>\n<li>First, the party receives a mission briefing from an actor playing the role of a portal specialist. At the end of the briefing, the actor asks if the party has any questions. The party must improvise dialogue by making a <strong>#DC# </strong>Performance or Society check.</li>\n<li>Second, the party travels through the portal (which is a casting of dancing lights) to fight actors wearing costumes of various creatures. The party must attempt convincing stage combat by making a <strong>#DC#</strong> Performance or Athletics check.</li>\n<li>Finally, the party comes across the treasure they seek, but it's across a large gorge that can only be crossed by swinging on a trapeze decorated to blend in with the scene's environment. The party must attempt to cross to the other side and retrieve the treasure by making a <strong>#DC# </strong>Performance or Acrobatics check.</li>\n<li>Depending on the amount of Victory Points the players have achieved, one of the following events occurs:\n<ul>\n<li>9+ Victory Points: The players receive a standing ovation as the curtain falls to signify the end of the act. The NPC who originally approached the PCs congratulations them on an incredible performance, and hands them a boquet of crystal flowers - a gift from a wealthy member of the audience. She also provides the PCs with a copy of the script, commenting that although their improvisation was incredible, they should brush up on their lines before the next act. While flipping through the script, the PCs find lines and stage directions that provide one piece of objective information. If the players try to wait for the next act instead of leaving the theater, they hear a conversation down the hallway about how someone has figured out that the PCs are not the actors who were supposed to be on stage; if they <em>still </em>don't leave the theater, the NPC sees through their disguises when she next sees the PCs and calls the guards.</li>\n<li>6-8 Victory Points: The players receive applause as the curtain falls to signify the end of the act. The NPC who originally approached the PCs provides them with a copy of the script, commenting that although their improvisation was admirable, they should brush on their lines before the next act. While flipping through the script, the PCs find lines and stage directions that provide one piece of objective information.

If she sees through one of their disguises, she runs out onto the stage and outs them. Otherwise, the curtain falls to signify the end of the act, and the NPC tells the PCs to leave her theater before she calls the guards.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Recommended Locations</h3>\n<p>City streets, tavern, marketplace, theater, though the entirety of this adventure can take place in the theater of the mind, unless combat breaks out and the players choose not to flee.</p>\n<h3>Recommended Creatures</h3>\n<p>This entire mission can be completed without combat (excluding the bar fight), but the GM may want to have some level-appropriate humanoid guards on hand just in case combat breaks out. If such a situation occurs, the GM may use up to 240 XP worth of guards in an encounter if combat breaks out - the PCs should be encouraged to run away. If combat breaks out in a secluded, private place, the creatures can fight in their un-masked aberration forms.</p>\n<h3>Recommended Loot</h3>\n<p>For each piece of objective information that the players uncover, they receive one-third of the total treasure budget in raw gold pieces. Before the mission begins, the GM should roll [[/r 1d6]] three times to determine which pieces of objective information can be obtained during the mission, rerolling any duplicate results.</p>\n<table style=\"width:94.0146%\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:53.2238%;text-align:center\">Die Result</td>\n<td style=\"width:46.6231%;text-align:center\">\n<p>Objective Information</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:53.2238%;text-align:center\">1</td>\n<td style=\"width:46.6231%;text-align:center\">One of the leaders of Taltain is a woman named Belle.

{"_id":"DX8nrfe6ZMyDslpv","name":"Taltain Mission B Appendix: How to Play Swindlebones","content":"<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>Swindlebones is the Covalon-themed version of Steve Jackson's Swindlestones. A simplified version of liar's dice, often played using knucklebones carved to make four-sided dice (or eight-sided dice with two faces for each number). The game is played between two players, often accompanied by a wager.</p>\n<h2>How to Play</h2>\n<p>Both players begin with five total knucklebones. At the beginning of each round, both players roll their knucklebones privately (use the \"Self Roll\" feature in Foundry). The player who goes first makes a bet by guessing the combined minimum number of dice showing a particular face that have been rolled by both players. For example, if a player says \"two threes,\" they are betting that between both players, two or more threes have been rolled. The opposing player may then either \"raise\" the bet, in which case they counter with a new bet, or they may \"call\" the bet, in which case both players reveal their dice to see if the last bet was correct. When a bet is called, if the bet turned out to be incorrect, the betting player loses one of their dice. If the bet turned out to be correct, the calling player loses one of their dice. The rounds repeat until one player no longer has any dice.</p>\n<h3>Rolling Dice</h3>\n<p>Players should roll their dice privately in Foundry so that their opponent cannot see the rolls until a bet is called. After rolling dice, a player can click on their roll card in the chat log to see the individual results of each roll. The following buttons can be used as roll shortcuts:</p>\n<p>5 dice: [[/sr 5d4]]<br />4 dice: [[/sr 4d4]]<br />3 dice: [[/sr 3d4]]<br />2 dice: [[/sr 2d4]]<br />1 die: [[/sr 1d4]]</p>\n<h3>Raising a Bet</h3>\n<p>When raising a bet, the raised bet must include a higher quantity of dice or the same quantity of dice with a greater face value. For example, if the previous bet was \"two threes,\" a raised bet could be \"two fours,\" \"three ones,\" or even \"six twos,\" but not \"two twos\" or \"one four.\"</p>\n<h3>Calling a Bet</h3>\n<p>When a bet is called, both players must reveal their dice (right-click on your roll in Foundry and choose the \"Reveal to Everyone\" option. The players then check to see if the combined dice have faces greater than or equal to the called bet. For example, if the called bet was \"two twos\" and there are three twos among both players, the bet is correct, but if there is only one two, the bet is incorrect. If the called bet is incorrect, the betting player loses a die. If the called bet is correct, the calling player loses a die.</p>\n<h3>Ending the Game</h3>\n<p>The game ends when one player no longer has any dice.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"7RtLbrlfn9D7fL4K":3},"flags":{}}
{"_id":"IWffjDtdeqxmnYNR","name":"Taltain Mission A: Nighttime Ambush","content":"<h3>Hook</h3>\n<p>Since arriving in Taltain, Covalon's expedition force quickly set up a network of spies around the city that listen for guard activity and do whatever they can to throw them off the scent of Covalon's trail. Covalon's adventurers in the city have not gone unnoticed, but so far, the main camp has yet to be discovered. In order to subvert the guards' efforts to find it, spies have been setting up decoy camps and tipping off the guards to their locations. The raids on these fake camps not only continue to ensure the safety of Covalon's main outpost, but also present an opportunity for Covalonians to sabotage the guards' future endeavors.</p>\n<p>Adventurers are tasked with camping out at one of these decoy bases and intercepting the guards that attempt to raid them, then sneaking over to the local guard precinct to sabotage their evidence and uncover any information that could assist Covalon's efforts in locate the Vessel of the Maw.</p>\n<h3>Required Elements</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Before the first encounter, the party must prepare their defenses for their decoy camp. The players may use any snares and long-duration spells  they possess (such as glyph of warding) to prepare defenses, and can also attempt to create up to three special defenses (chosen from the below list) to help secure their camp's permiter.\n<ul>\n<li>Bear Trap: <strong>#DC# </strong>Survival check to create. Occupies a 5-foot square and deals <strong>#Hazard 2-16 Complex Damage# </strong>piercing damage to a creature that stands on it, with a <strong>#Hazard 2-16 HDC# </strong>basic Reflex save; on a failure, the creature is also immobilized for 1 round.</li>\n<li>Hidden Pit: <strong>#DC# </strong>Stealth check to create. Occupies a 10-foot square and causes the first creature that steps on it to fall into a pit that is 10 feet deep, taking 5 damage and landing prone as per the normal falling rules. To climb out, a creature must succeed at a <strong>#Hazard 2-16 HDC# </strong>Athletics check to Climb.</li>\n<li>Spear Launcher: <strong>#DC# </strong>Crafting check to create. Occupies a 5-foot square and deals <strong>#Hazard 2-16 Simple Damage# </strong>piercing damage to a creature that steps in it, with a <strong>#Hazard 2-16 HDC# </strong>basic Reflex save.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The players must also set up a watch schedule. The players don't know when the guards will be coming, so they need to divide themselves to keep watch between three different shifts. During each shift, any number of players may choose to be awake and any number of players may choose to sleep, but any PC that doesn't choose to sleep for at least two shifts is fatigued for the rest of the mission (unless they have an abiltiy that prevents them from requiring sleep). Additionally, players must sleep unarmored, or they become fatigued immediately on waking up (unless they have an ability that allows them to sleep in armor, such as armor with the Comfort trait).</li>\n<li>After defenses have been placed and watches have been established, the GM rolls [[/r 1d3]] to determine during which watch the ambush occurs. When the ambush occurs, the players who were awake roll initiative as normal, but the sleeping players roll initiative with a -4 penalty, and will probably need to use their first actions during combat to stand up and grab their weapons.</li>\n<li>After surviving the ambush, the players will need to quickly make their way to the nearest guard precinct to infiltrate it while it's low on guards. The next encounter should take place on the way to the guard precinct, with the final encounter taking place inside the precinct.</li>\n<li>Inside the precinct, the players find maps and notes detailing the Covalonians' activities, and the players can sabotage this evidence by destroying them or creating edits to mislead the guards. A player who searches and succeeds at a <strong>#DC+2# </strong>Perception check notices some hidden notes written in Aklo. When deciphered, the notes read: \"The Seed requires a steady supply of blood to nourish it. Detain any large sources of blood and notify Captain Darkscale immediately.\"</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Recommended Locations</h3>\n<p>Plains, forests, jungles, and beaches for the camp. Urban streets, rooftops, and urban indoors for the rest of the mission.</p>\n<h3>Recommended Creatures</h3>\n<p>Humanoids, maybe with the occassional animal companion. Alternatively, the creatures can fight in their un-masked aberration forms if they're not in a public place.</p>\n<h3>Recommended Loot</h3>\n<p>Any.

{"_id":"i1sTyxKhAvSzHtmt","name":"Taltain Finale","content":"<h2>Taltain Finale: The Council of Taltain</h2>\n<h3>Hook</h3>\n<p>On its surface, Taltain appeared to be a city untouched by the Cataclysm, but the adventurers of Covalon were not so easily deceived. Behind the wooden masks of Taltain's citizenry hid aberrations connected to a hivemind that instructed them to imitate the former civilization. Though it's still not clear why the aberrations were doing this, the Covalonians uncovered their enabler - a Vessel of the Maw, kept under guard by the city's twisted councilors in a building called the Quinate. Though the Vessel has been destroyed, the Seed transplanted in the Quinate still needs rotating shifts of guards be protected it from the facsimiles of the councilors that appear on its doorstep.</p>\n<h3>Conflict in the Quinate</h3>\n<p>The Maw is aware that its Vessel in Taltain has been destroyed, and it is not content to take the loss without retaliation. Facsimiles of the Taltain councilors have appeared in Taltain, but engaging them among the people in the city is a certain death sentence. They need to be fought in a location away from the eyes and ears of the rest of the city, and it just so happens that the Quinate serves as the perfect battleground.</p>\n<p>The PCs begin near the councilors' chairs at the north end of the map, while the five councilors start at the southern end of the map. The doors behind the councilors swing shut as they enter, and they will refuse to retreat or use the outside hallway during the fight. The platform at the north end of the room featuring the chairs is only a foot high and can be reached from the ground as part of a Stride, Step, or any other normal move action without being considered difficult terrain. The ceiling is a dome, but for ease of play, it should be treated as 30 feet high in all areas. The six pillars in the Quinate extend from the floor to the ceiling, providing cover and blocking line of effect like normal terrain. The PCs are serving a full guard shift as part of this adventure, so they won't have sufficient advance notice of when the facsimiles of the councilors arrive to use abilities or items that grant short-term beneficial effects (though anything with a duration of 8 hours or longer can be used).</p>\n<p>If the GM has not done so yet, they should select one of the three Modifications to apply (found on The Assembled Council of Taltain's statblock) or roll [[/r 1d3]] to determine one randomly. Do not tell the players which Modification is in effect. (For Hard Mode, use all 3 modifications.) Note: The modifications only apply to The Assembled Council of Taltain; any abilities or effects they grant are not applied to the individual councilors.</p>\n<p>Should the PCs need to escape from the encounter, they can do by spending one action to open one of the doors at the south end of the arena and then moving south of them. Players may not fight from outside the building; any PC that moves past the doors should be removed from the encounter and is considered to have escaped.</p>\n<h3>Tactics Overview</h3>\n<p>The fight begins with the players facing off against the five councilors of Taltain. They each have unique abilities, but their tactics are mostly straightforward.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Belle prefers to stay close to enemy spellcasters so she can interrupt them with Not Your Line!. She should focus on using her reach to trip enemy spellcasters or problematic enemies, and if she's in range of an ally, she can also use Whip into Shape! to make efficient use of an action instead of spending it on a third attack roll.</li>\n<li>Carloni uses her Thunder-Thrower to target enemies that her fellow councilors are attacking while she uses Battle Graft to nimbly \"heal\" her allies. If the opportunity presents itself to where she can hit a decent number of allies and/or enemies with Ultravolt!, she should take it, especially if it can also hit a pillar.</li>\n<li>Darkscale should use Agitating Shadows immediately upon his first turn to sow chaos among the PCs. Although the other councilors will also be affected by the sight limit form this ability, they can use the darkness to reach opportune positions for future turns. Aside from that, he can use Shadow Jump to quickly travel the battlefield and his powerful Strikes to inflict large amounts of damage on high-priority targets.</li>\n<li>Ferdi should try to use Hunt Heretic every turn, if possible. His Hatred of Heretics ability requires him to focus on attacking creatures with visible symbols of deity, and the 100 ft. range of his rifle will allow him to do so in most circumstances. While Agitating Shadows is in effect, Ferdi can use Chameleon Skin to become undetected to the PCs, and he can also use it before using Hunt Heretic to make his target flat-footed.</li>\n<li>Oster should attempt to use his Mega Bomb when he can hit as many PCs as possible without hitting any of his allies; if he rolls well on initiative, his first turn is opportune for this. His Pyromaniac ability gives his HP some significant heft, so he shouldn't be adverse to fighting on the front lines.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once two councilors are defeated, the Coagulating Council ability triggers and The Assembled Council of Taltain appears. The Assembled Council's beginning position is to the GM's discretion, but should be somewhere close to the center of the Quinate. Instead of rolling initiative, it gets slotted in at the position of the councilor who as next up in the initiative order when Coagulating Council was triggered.</p>\n<p>At the end of each of its turns, the Assembled Council triggers Shifting Form. The GM should always give a brief description of which form the Assembled Council is entering - and for Gun Arm Form in particular, the GM should be sure to announce which PC is the target of the Assembled Council's focus (when the Tricky Form Modification is enabled, be sure to hint at the tricked form instead, including a target if Gun Arm Form is the tricked form). The ability granted by the selected form should be used as the first action(s) of the Assembled Council's next turn, if possible. Here are some specific details for each form:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bomber Form is simple. When the Assembled Council's turn next comes up, they should use Mega-Bomb Barrage as their first actions. (Allowing them to Stride first prevents the PCs from appropriately using the pillars to counter the ability.)</li>\n<li>Gun Arm Form should use Arm Cannon as their first actions on their next turn as well. The line for this ability can originate from any of the Assembled Council's squares.</li>\n<li>Duelist Form causes the Assembled Council to enter Duelist Dance immediately, meaning they can use their new reactions before their next turn. They can use one reaction on every creature's turn, plus one additional reaction before their next turn, meaning that one particularly unlucky creature could receive two of the Assembled Council's reactions while in this form.</li>\n<li>Shadowcaller Form uses Swirling Darkness immediately, but the effects have an important order to them. First, any creature <em>farther</em> than 10 feet away from the Assembled Council must make the required Will save; creatures 10 feet away or closer to the Assembled Council automatically succeed. Afterwards, the Assembled Council can teleport 60 feet. The teleport must occur <em>after</em> the Will saves, as the players should be guaranteed to avoid the effect if they use their turn to move within 10 feet of the Assembled Council.</li>\n<li>Mad Scientist Form should use OMEGAVOLT! as their first actions on their next turn. It is best to switch to this form when enemies are close to the pillars, such as after using Bomber Form. The red squares on the arena designate the 10 foot emanations around each pillar - these can be seen by the GM but are hidden to the players.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If the Flesh Pods Modification is enabled, the Assembled Council should direct their minions to harry hard-to-reach enemies, or they can be used to provide flanking for the Assembled Council's attacks in addition to using their other abilities. If the Destablisiation Modification is in play, it can be used to punish PCs that hug too close together, such as if they attempt to mititgate damage being dealt to an Arm Cannon target.</p>\n<h3>Loot</h3>\n<p>The entirety of the treasure budget is given out in raw GP, paid by the NPC used for the hook. Additionally, players unlock the ability to customize their Soul Seed, gaining access to the Soul aspect.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"7RtLbrlfn9D7fL4K":3},"flags":{}}
{"_id":"nTK5DILsM18H4eOP","name":"Taltain Briefing","content":"<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>For most of history, Taltain was a relatively quiet nation. Generations of noble families ruled the island chain, providing work and safety to the peasant class in exchange for their loyalty and a percentage of the fruits of their labor. The situation was never particularly ideal for the majority of Taltain's citizenry, but knowing no other way of life, they didn't think too much about it.</p>\n<p>As the civilizations of the world developed and advanced, Taltain was mostly excluded from international politics, due to their location on the far side of the world and the isolationist policies of the nobility. Still, traders from Gornlar would share stories of the freeholds' exploits, and over time, the peasants of Taltain became envious of the lives their neighbors were living. The nobles, too, were paying attention to the rest of the world, and their eyes were set on Keydo in particular. The divine emperor was ruthlessly expanding the empire to cover the entirety of the Dragon Isles, and the Taltain nobility figured it was only a matter of time before the empire would desire their lands, too.</p>\n<p>For the first time in its history, the feudal structure of Taltain changed dramatically. The nobles absorbed everything the peasants produced, becoming the sole controller of wealth and commodities. They strictly rationed out food, clothing, and other necessities to the peasants, but without the logistic prowess to do so efficiently, leading to frustration and even periods of starvation among the working class. The nobles rationalized their actions by believing these were necessary preparations for a coming invasion, but the invasion that manifested was not the one they predicted.</p>\n<p>Pushed to a breaking point, citizens of Taltain abandoned the nation in droves, landing in Gornlar as refugees and begging for the great warriors of the freeholds to help them overthrow the oppressive nobility. Fleets of Gornlarian ships arrived on Taltain's shores, and the nation's army stood down as the mercenaries from the freeholds ransacked the nobles' palaces, ending the ruling class' reign overnight.</p>\n<p>For ten years, Taltain floundered in anarchy. The Gornlarian mercenaries took a liking to the islands and attempted to establish new freeholds, though these amounted to little more than gangs amidst a population that was interested in finally having the opportunity to govern themselves. Unfortunately for the peasants, their lack of education made them ill-suited for the task; verbal agreements over drinks at the tavern and threats of retaliation on the edges of buildings were the glue that held what was hardly a semblance of society together. Order would eventually find its way to Taltain via the Cataclysm - aberrations disguised as friends, neighbors, and even spouses revealed themselves in a coordinated attack that massacred an unprepared and disorganized society.</p>\n<p>For more information on Taltain, see its entry in the <a href=\"https://scribe.pf2.tools/v/8vMfPSF7-covalon-player-s-guide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Covalon Player's Guide</a>.</p>\n<h2>Mission Overview</h2>\n<p>The apparatus of the octopus arrived on the shores of Taltain unmolested - a first in Covalon's history of expeditions. Even more surprising, the capital city appeared to be in good condition, and there were even people going about their daily lives like the world wasn't a post-apocalyptic hellscape. But on further inspection, the Covalonians could see that something wasn't quite right. The way the people moved was so deliberate, it was almost mechanical, and there was a synchronicity between them all that gave the impression that they were all in on some sort of sinister plan together. But perhaps the most peculiar thing about the people were the strange wooden masks they wore, hiding everything on their faces except for their eyes and mouths. Secreting themselves in an abandoned tavern on the outskirts of town, the Covlonians prepare to explore the city, creating their own masks to blend in - the aberrations that recently conquered Taltain may still be hiding among the remaining population. There is surely a Vessel of the Maw hiding here, but in a city this big, it could be anywhere.</p>\n<h2>Special Notes about Taltain</h2>\n<p>Taltain's expedition is unlike any adventure type in Covalon's campaign thus far. Social encounters will be common, and GMs may find themselves roleplaying as a variety of different NPCs for PCs who are trying to stay disguised. Here are some details that GMs should keep in mind during Taltain expedition missions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>NPCs in Taltain are human-like, but not exactly human. In fact, they are <em>all</em> aberrations (such as faceless stalkers) posing as regular people, hiding behind wooden masks. Their speech may contain idioms that don't make sense (such as \"the cobblers in the marketplace are just fishing for owls\"), their routines may seem nonsensical or redundant (such as a woman who carries water from one well only to pour it into another, repeated endlessly), and they may occasionally exhibit inexplicable synchronized movements that they don't acknowledge (such as every person in a room simultaneously hiccuping).</li>\n<li>Most encountered in Taltain will be aberrations posing as humanoids, and they fight using statblocks for humanoids. The NPCs from the NPC Gallery in the Gamemastery Guide work great for these. For higher level enemies, there are a handful of statblocks in the Lost Omens Character Guide, but GMs may need to use the creature creation rules from the Gamemastery Guide to level up other NPCs.</li>\n<li>PCs will be using the Impersonate exploration activity to pass themselves off as ordinary mask-wearing citizens of Taltain during missions, which requires each player using a disguise kit and making a Deception skill check to Impersonate - PCs without training in Deception should be advised to Follow the Expert on someone who does. As a reminder, regardless of the result of their Impersonate checks, NPCs only receive a chance to see through the PC's disguises if they use an action to Seek, and most NPCs should not attempt this unless they're given a reason to be suspicious of the PCs (see below).</li>\n<li>PCs should be encouraged to engage with NPCs to gather information that will help them complete their mission, but they must be careful not to raise suspicion as they do so. All NPCs start with an attitude of Indifferent towards the players, but this attitude is automatically lowered by one step if any PC mentions any of the following topics: the Cataclysm, the Maw, the Heart of Terra, the Heart of the Maw, aberrations disguised as people, the aberrations that overthrew Taltain, the wooden masks that everyone wears, or anything that questions what seems like perfectly normal customs to the Taltainians. When an NPC's attitude becomes unfriendly, they attempt a check to Seek and potentially uncover the triggering player's disguise, using a Perception modifier of <strong>#DC -10#</strong>. If they successfully see through the player's disguise (or their attitude becomes hostile), they may call for guards or engage the PCs in combat themselves. If the location is sufficiently crowded, there may be too many hostiles for the PCs to have a reasonable chance at victory, and they may need to retreat.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How to Run an Expedition</h2>\n<p>Expeditions are composed of two subtypes: missions and finales. Missions are a set of three dungeon-like adventures that are narratively linked, but can be completed in any order. Each mission must include predetermined narrative and mechanical elements while sticking to a theme of locations, creatures, and loot, which are included in its associated journal entry, with the specifics of the blanks to be filled in by the GM of the adventure. Like other adventure types, Dungeon Guides must submit their expedition missions for approval.</p>\n<p>When reading the instructions for an expedition, you may see key terms surrounded by number signs. These indicate that the term should be replaced by a value that's dependent on the adventure's average party level.  If you have any questions about how to apply these terms or any of the required elements, be sure to ask about them during your submission for approval. Here is a list of terms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>#Creature [Table Number] [Modifier]#</strong> should be replaced by a value according to a table in the <a href=\"https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=995\">Building Creatures</a> section of the Gamemastery Guide. For example, \"#Creature 2-8 Minimum# means that you should reference the Building Creatures rules, look for Table 2-8, and use the value in the Minimum column for the creature's level (adjusted for elite or weak as appropriate).</li>\n<li><strong>#Hazard [Table Number] [Modifier]# </strong>should be replaced by a value according to a table in the <a href=\"https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=1043\">Building Hazards</a> section of the Gamemastery Guide. For example, \"#Hazard 2-16 Simple Damage# means that you should reference the Building Hazards rules, look for table 2-16, and use the value in the Simple Damage column for the hazard's level.</li>\n<li><strong>#DC [Modifier]# </strong>should be replaced by a value according to the <a href=\"https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=554\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DCs by Level</a> table in the Core Rulebook. If a modifier is included, the value should be adjusted accordingly. For example, \"#DC +5#\" means that you should reference the DCs by Level table, find the value appropriate for the party's average level, then add 5 to it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Finales are singular encounters against a narratively significant threat that conclude an expedition. They come in two versions: normal mode and hard mode. Before a finale is cleared for the first time, it can only be run by Covalon administrators and moderators, and is ran at hard mode. Afterwards, the finale can be ran by any Dungeon Guide at normal mode (though players can request hard mode if they'd like). Normal mode can be run in Tier 2 or above, and hard mode can only be run at the highest tier, intended for max level characters. Unlike missions, finales use a specific map and specific creatures, included with this module.</p>\n<p>Each finale comes with three variant modifications. When running a normal mode finale, a GM choose one of the three modifications to use, or can roll [[/r 1d3]] to randomly determine which modification to use. When running a hard mode finale, the GM uses all three modifications. There are no additional rewards for completing hard mode.</p>\n<h2>Reporting a Completed Expedition</h2>\n<p>When reporting a completed expedition in the Dungeon Summaries channel, use the <strong>exact name</strong> of the adventure as the adventure's title. For example, if you ran the first mission of Ikouga, the summary's title should be \"Ikouga Mission A: Retame the Island\" exactly. The summary should otherwise follow the same format as dungeons.</p>\n<p>Finally, any narrative-based knowledge or intrigue that the players gain as a result of the expedition should be left out of the summary. For example, if the players complete a bonus objective that allows them to learn special information as detailed in the Required Elements or Recommended Loot section of each journal entry, that should be left out of the dungeon summary.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"7RtLbrlfn9D7fL4K":3},"flags":{}}
{"_id":"oJC5dZ8UF7AO0xJR","name":"Taltain Mission C: Palace Infiltration","content":"<h3>Hook</h3>\n<p>The palaces from the old aristocracy before the people's revolution are still standing in Taltain. It's possible that they could hold secrets regarding what's going on in the city, or, if nothing else, valuable treasure. The palaces are too heavily guarded for traditional infiltration, so adventurers will need to sneak in. It is highly recommended that parties attempting this mission contain at least one stealth expert.</p>\n<h3>Required Elements</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>To infiltrate the palace, the party must first find a way in, making appropriate skill checks against a DC of <strong>#DC#</strong> in order to enter. Obvious points of entry may include scaling the exterior to enter via a balcony (Athletics), disguising themselves as servants to enter through the servants' quarters (Deception), or quietly unlocking and opening a door from the outside (Thievery), but the GM may include other points of entry at their discretion.</li>\n<li>Once inside the palace, the PCs are free to explore. Ocassionally, a patrolling guard will make their way towards the PCs, which can be detected in advance by a Scouting PC who succeeds at a <strong>#DC# </strong>Perception check. When a patrolling guard is detected, the PCs can hide by ducking into an adjacent room (if available) or using skill checks against a DC of <strong>#DC#</strong>. Stealth can always be used, but other skills may be applicable depending on the room, such as using Athletics to hang from rafters or Survival to create makeshift camouflage from nearby boxes and barrels. If the guard does not detect the players, the players can continue exploration after the guard passes, but if the guard detects the players, he alerts other guards nearby, beginning an encounter with a maximum XP budget of 160 instead of the usual 120 (which should almost always result in an additional guard equal to the party level). A maximum of three encounters can be triggered this way; if a third encounter is triggered, patrols in the palace will cease. It is possible to complete this adventure without triggering any encounters.</li>\n<li>The palace should include three of the following rooms which contain clues. The first room listed is mandatory, while the other two rooms can be selected by rolling [[/r 1d6]].</li>\n</ol>\n<table style=\"width:94.0146%;height:494px\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:19px\">\n<td style=\"width:48.876%;text-align:center;height:19px\">Die Result</td>\n<td style=\"width:50.9709%;text-align:center;height:19px\">Palace Room with Clue</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:171px\">\n<td style=\"width:48.876%;text-align:center;height:171px\">Mandatory</td>\n<td style=\"width:50.9709%;text-align:center;height:171px\">A great hall contains a gargantuan clump of pulsing flesh anchored to the ceiling.

Alternatively, the creatures can fight in their un-masked aberration forms if they aren't within the main thoroughfares of the palace, but due to the increased XP budgets, GMs should opt to use aberrations equal or lesser than the party's level instead of aberrations higher than the party's level.</p>\n<h3>Recommended Loot</h3>\n<p>80% of the treasure budget can be composed of any loot. The players are then awarded 10% of the total treasure budget in raw gold pieces for each clue the clues they uncover in the palace, for a total of 30% if they find all three rooms and succeed at both skill checks.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"7RtLbrlfn9D7fL4K":3},"flags":{}}

Generations of noble families ruled the island chain, providing work and safety to the peasant class in exchange for their loyalty and a percentage of the fruits of their labor. The situation was never particularly ideal for the majority of Taltain's citizenry, but knowing no other way of life, they didn't think too much about it.</p>\n<p>As the civilizations of the world developed and advanced, Taltain was mostly excluded from international politics, due to their location on the far side of the world and the isolationist policies of the nobility. Still, traders from Gornlar would share stories of the freeholds' exploits, and over time, the peasants of Taltain became envious of the lives their neighbors were living. The nobles, too, were paying attention to the rest of the world, and their eyes were set on Keydo in particular. The divine emperor was ruthlessly expanding the empire to cover the entirety of the Dragon Isles, and the Taltain nobility figured it was only a matter of time before the empire would desire their lands, too.</p>\n<p>For the first time in its history, the feudal structure of Taltain changed dramatically. The nobles absorbed everything the peasants produced, becoming the sole controller of wealth and commodities. They strictly rationed out food, clothing, and other necessities to the peasants, but without the logistic prowess to do so efficiently, leading to frustration and even periods of starvation among the working class. The nobles rationalized their actions by believing these were necessary preparations for a coming invasion, but the invasion that manifested was not the one they predicted.</p>\n<p>Pushed to a breaking point, citizens of Taltain abandoned the nation in droves, landing in Gornlar as refugees and begging for the great warriors of the freeholds to help them overthrow the oppressive nobility. Fleets of Gornlarian ships arrived on Taltain's shores, and the nation's army stood down as the mercenaries from the freeholds ransacked the nobles' palaces, ending the ruling class' reign overnight.</p>\n<p>For ten years, Taltain floundered in anarchy. The Gornlarian mercenaries took a liking to the islands and attempted to establish new freeholds, though these amounted to little more than gangs amidst a population that was interested in finally having the opportunity to govern themselves.

Covalon's adventurers in the city have not gone unnoticed, but so far, the main camp has yet to be discovered. In order to subvert the guards' efforts to find it, spies have been setting up decoy camps and tipping off the guards to their locations. The raids on these fake camps not only continue to ensure the safety of Covalon's main outpost, but also present an opportunity for Covalonians to sabotage the guards' future endeavors.</p><p>Adventurers are tasked with camping out at one of these decoy bases and intercepting the guards that attempt to raid them, then sneaking over to the local guard precinct to sabotage their evidence and uncover any information that could assist Covalon's efforts in locate the Vessel of the Maw.</p><h3>Required Elements</h3><ol><li><p>Before the first encounter, the party must prepare their defenses for their decoy camp. The players may use any snares and long-duration spells  they possess (such as glyph of warding) to prepare defenses, and can also attempt to create up to three special defenses (chosen from the below list) to help secure their camp's permiter.</p><ul><li>Bear Trap: <strong>#DC# </strong>Survival check to create. Occupies a 5-foot square and deals <strong>#Hazard 2-16 Complex Damage# </strong>piercing damage to a creature that stands on it, with a <strong>#Hazard 2-16 HDC# </strong>basic Reflex save; on a failure, the creature is also immobilized for 1 round.</li><li>Hidden Pit: <strong>#DC# </strong>Stealth check to create. Occupies a 10-foot square and causes the first creature that steps on it to fall into a pit that is 10 feet deep, taking 5 damage and landing prone as per the normal falling rules. To climb out, a creature must succeed at a <strong>#Hazard 2-16 HDC# </strong>Athletics check to Climb.</li><li>Spear Launcher: <strong>#DC# </strong>Crafting check to create. Occupies a 5-foot square and deals <strong>#Hazard 2-16 Simple Damage# </strong>piercing damage to a creature that steps in it, with a <strong>#Hazard 2-16 HDC# </strong>basic Reflex save.</li></ul></li><li>The players must also set up a watch schedule. The players don't know when the guards will be coming, so they need to divide themselves to keep watch between three different shifts. During each shift, any number of players may choose to be awake and any number of players may choose to sleep, but any PC that doesn't choose to sleep for at least two shifts is fatigued for the rest of the mission (unless they have an abiltiy that prevents them from requiring sleep). Additionally, players must sleep unarmored, or they become fatigued immediately on waking up (unless they have an ability that allows them to sleep in armor, such as armor with the Comfort trait).</li><li>After defenses have been placed and watches have been established, the GM rolls [[/r 1d3]] to determine during which watch the ambush occurs. When the ambush occurs, the players who were awake roll initiative as normal, but the sleeping players roll initiative with a -4 penalty, and will probably need to use their first actions during combat to stand up and grab their weapons.</li><li>After surviving the ambush, the players will need to quickly make their way to the nearest guard precinct to infiltrate it while it's low on guards. The next encounter should take place on the way to the guard precinct, with the final encounter taking place inside the precinct.</li><li>Inside the precinct, the players find maps and notes detailing the Covalonians' activities, and the players can sabotage this evidence by destroying them or creating edits to mislead the guards. A player who searches and succeeds at a <strong>#DC+2# </strong>Perception check notices some hidden notes written in Aklo. When deciphered, the notes read: \"The Seed requires a steady supply of blood to nourish it.

Covalon's spies have reported that the people of Taltain are amicable to conversation as long as they believe they're talking to a fellow citizen, so the adventurers are tasked with disguising themselves and talking to the citzenry directly to gather information.</p><h3>Required Elements</h3><ol><li>During the briefing, the PCs should be informed that they will need to put together disguises for this mission. Each player will need a disguise kit (which can be purchased from the general store if the PC does not have one) and will need to roll a Deception check to Impersonate a villager. Each PC needs to make their own Deception check, but they can Follow the Expert if they are unskilled in Deception, and other players can Aid as normal. (As a reminder, regardless of the result of the PCs' Impersonate checks, NPCs only receive a chance to see through the PC's disguises if they use an action to Seek, and most NPCs should not attempt this unless they're given a reason to be suspicious of the PCs.)</li><li><p>After the players have assumed their disguises, the players are instructed to meet with a spy in the field who will give them vital tips on how to interact with the citzenry. The spy informs the PCs that although the people of Taltain are amicable to conversation, there are a few key topics that should be avoided, as they seem to instantly raise suspicion among the citizens. When an NPC has their suspicion raised, their attitude drops to Unfriendly and they Seek the triggering PC with a Perception modifier of <strong>#DC -10#</strong>. If they see through the disguise, or if their attitude is made hostile, they will either engage the PCs in combat or call for guards if they are not fit for combat themselves. Below are topics that will raise suspicion among NPCs:</p><ul><li>The Cataclysm</li><li>The Maw, the Heart of the Maw, Vessels of the Maw</li><li>The Heart of Terra, Covalon</li><li>Aberrations disguised as people, aberrations that overthrew Taltain</li><li>The wooden masks that everyone wears, questioning local customs or idioms, questioning anything that might be common knowledge to citizens</li><li>Being \"new in town\"</li><li>Trying to get an NPC to divulge additional information after they've already revaled one piece of objective information (keep this topic a secret from the PCs)</li></ul></li><li>The spy tells the PCs that they won't be able to outright ask if there's a Vessel of the Maw in the city, or where it's being kept, but there are two things they can ask about that could prove vital to Covalon's investigation: who is in charge of the city, and where it is they congregate. The spy indicates that there are three locations that would be worth gathering investigation in: a tavern, a marketplace, and a theater. There are no mandatory combat encounters in this adventure - instead, each location's social encounter constitutes 120 XP in the XP budget, though these encounters may become combat encounters if the citizens become suspicious of the PCs. The PCs can earn one piece of objective information from each location, selected from the list in the Required Loot section. The players can visit these three locations in any order.</li><li>In the tavern, players can choose to approach either the patrons or the barkeep. The patrons are rowdy and difficult to impress or get along with, and regardless of how friendly the PCs are, the patrons will eventually ask the PCs to leave them alone, leading to a bar fight if the players do not comply. The bar fight is a normal 120 XP combat encounter, except all enemies use non-lethal force. If any player makes a lethal attack, all enemies immediately switch to using lethal force instead and the barkeep calls for additional guards, which will likely overwhelm the PCs if they do not flee. Should the PCs win the bar fight nonlethally, the patrons will immediately become Friendly with the PCs and voluntarily offer up one piece of objective information to the players.</li><li><p>If the PCs instead choose to approach the barkeep, they will find the barkeep difficult to Make an Impression with (<strong>#DC 5#</strong>)<strong>,</strong> and even more difficult to Request information from (<strong>#DC +10#</strong>), remarking that he doesn't feel like talking unless the PCs buy drinks for him and themselves. If the PCs do so, the barkeep challenges them to a drinking contest to make things more interesting. Should the PCs win, he will be open to having a conversation with them, but should they lose, they will have to buy drinks for the whole tavern. (A mug of ale is 1 copper piece, so this does not amount to a relevant cost.) The barkeep tells the PCs that they can all work together to attempt to outdrink him.</p><ul><li>The first team to reach 18 Victory Points wins. </li><li><p>Each PC rolls initiative, with the barkeep taking a turn after each PC. During their turn, a PC can perform one of three actions:</p><ul><li><strong>Drink!</strong> The participant drinks. The participant attempts a <strong>#DC# </strong>Fortitude save, earning 1 Victory Point on a success. When the barkeep performs this action, his modifier is <strong>#DC -5#</strong>.</li><li><strong>Chug! Chug! Chug! </strong>The pariticpant drinks a lot. The participant attempts a <strong>#DC +4# </strong>Fortitude save, earning 3 Victory Points on a success. The barkeep only performs this action if he is currently losing by at least 3 points, and his modifier is <strong>#DC -5#</strong>.</li><li><strong>Cheer On!</strong> The participant cheers on their ally. The next ally who attempts a Fortitude save during the drinking contest gains a +1 circumstance bonus to their save.</li></ul></li><li>If the PCs win the game, the bartender's attitude becomes helpful and he divulges one piece of objective information to the party. If the bartender wins the game, he and the patrons laugh the PCs out of the tavern, refusing to talk to them for having weak stomachs.</li></ul></li><li>The marketplace is mostly empty. There are several merchants in stalls, but they are more interested in hawking junk than conversing with the PCs. There is one NPC interested in talking to them - a gambler on a carpet waves them over and invites them to play Swindlebones. While playing, the gambler is interested in making conversation - this is a good opportunity for the PCs to try to get information out of him. The players can also wager gold in exchange for information, but the gambler is a high stakes player, and won't be enticed by bets less than 10% of the adventure's total treasure budget. Otherwise, the gambler is happy to play without stakes. Whether through being beaten at Swindlebones or by being distracted by conversation during the game, the gambler will no longer play after revealing one piece of objective information. For information on how to play Swindlebones, see the \"Taltain Mission B Appendix: How to Play Swindlebones\" journal entry.</li><li><p>As the PCs approach the theater, they are stopped by an NPC who mistakes the PCs as the missing actors for the show that is about to begin. The NPC attempts to hurry the players through a side door and shove them onto a stage; if the players don't comply, the NPC becomes suspicious. If the players do comply, they are immediately thrust into a scene in a play where they take on the role of six adventurers going on an adventure through a portal to find treasure to bring back home - a scenario eerily similar to the operations of the Dungeoneering Society back in Covalon. For each scene, the party must make at least one check - each success awards 1 Victory Point, a critical success earns 2 Victory Points, and a critical failure causes the party to lose 1 Victory Point.</p><ul><li>First, the party receives a mission briefing from an actor playing the role of a portal specialist. At the end of the briefing, the actor asks if the party has any questions. The party must improvise dialogue by making a <strong>#DC# </strong>Performance or Society check.</li><li>Second, the party travels through the portal (which is a casting of dancing lights) to fight actors wearing costumes of various creatures. The party must attempt convincing stage combat by making a <strong>#DC#</strong> Performance or Athletics check.</li><li>Finally, the party comes across the treasure they seek, but it's across a large gorge that can only be crossed by swinging on a trapeze decorated to blend in with the scene's environment. The party must attempt to cross to the other side and retrieve the treasure by making a <strong>#DC# </strong>Performance or Acrobatics check.</li><li><p>Depending on the amount of Victory Points the players have achieved, one of the following events occurs:</p><ul><li>9+ Victory Points: The players receive a standing ovation as the curtain falls to signify the end of the act. The NPC who originally approached the PCs congratulations them on an incredible performance, and hands them a boquet of crystal flowers - a gift from a wealthy member of the audience. She also provides the PCs with a copy of the script, commenting that although their improvisation was incredible, they should brush up on their lines before the next act. While flipping through the script, the PCs find lines and stage directions that provide one piece of objective information. If the players try to wait for the next act instead of leaving the theater, they hear a conversation down the hallway about how someone has figured out that the PCs are not the actors who were supposed to be on stage; if they <em>still </em>don't leave the theater, the NPC sees through their disguises when she next sees the PCs and calls the guards.</li><li>6-8 Victory Points: The players receive applause as the curtain falls to signify the end of the act. The NPC who originally approached the PCs provides them with a copy of the script, commenting that although their improvisation was admirable, they should brush on their lines before the next act. While flipping through the script, the PCs find lines and stage directions that provide one piece of objective information. If the players try to wait for the next act instead of leaving the theater, they hear a conversation down the hallway about how someone has figured out that the PCs are not the actors who were supposed to be on stage; if they <em>still </em>don't leave the theater, the NPC sees through their disguises when she next sees the PCs and calls the guards.</li><li>5 or less Victory Points: The audience boos the PCs, and the original NPC who approached the PCs becomes suspicious. If she sees through one of their disguises, she runs out onto the stage and outs them. Otherwise, the curtain falls to signify the end of the act, and the NPC tells the PCs to leave her theater before she calls the guards.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ol><h3>Recommended Locations</h3><p>City streets, tavern, marketplace, theater, though the entirety of this adventure can take place in the theater of the mind, unless combat breaks out and the players choose not to flee.</p><h3>Recommended Creatures</h3><p>This entire mission can be completed without combat (excluding the bar fight), but the GM may want to have some level-appropriate humanoid guards on hand just in case combat breaks out. If such a situation occurs, the GM may use up to 240 XP worth of guards in an encounter if combat breaks out - the PCs should be encouraged to run away. If combat breaks out in a secluded, private place, the creatures can fight in their un-masked aberration forms.</p><h3>Recommended Loot</h3><p>For each piece of objective information that the players uncover, they receive one-third of the total treasure budget in raw gold pieces. Before the mission begins, the GM should roll [[/r 1d6]] three times to determine which pieces of objective information can be obtained during the mission, rerolling any duplicate results.</p><table style=\"width:94.0146%\" border=\"1\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"width:53.2238%;text-align:center\">Die Result</td><td style=\"width:46.6231%;text-align:center\"><p>Objective Information</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"width:53.2238%;text-align:center\">1</td><td style=\"width:46.6231%;text-align:center\">One of the leaders of Taltain is a woman named Belle.

It is highly recommended that parties attempting this mission contain at least one stealth expert.</p><h3>Required Elements</h3><ol><li>To infiltrate the palace, the party must first find a way in, making appropriate skill checks against a DC of <strong>#DC#</strong> in order to enter.

When a patrolling guard is detected, the PCs can hide by ducking into an adjacent room (if available) or using skill checks against a DC of <strong>#DC#</strong>. Stealth can always be used, but other skills may be applicable depending on the room, such as using Athletics to hang from rafters or Survival to create makeshift camouflage from nearby boxes and barrels. If the guard does not detect the players, the players can continue exploration after the guard passes, but if the guard detects the players, he alerts other guards nearby, beginning an encounter with a maximum XP budget of 160 instead of the usual 120 (which should almost always result in an additional guard equal to the party level). A maximum of three encounters can be triggered this way; if a third encounter is triggered, patrols in the palace will cease.

A simplified version of liar's dice, often played using knucklebones carved to make four-sided dice (or eight-sided dice with two faces for each number). The game is played between two players, often accompanied by a wager.</p><h2>How to Play</h2><p>Both players begin with five total knucklebones. At the beginning of each round, both players roll their knucklebones privately (use the \"Self Roll\" feature in Foundry). The player who goes first makes a bet by guessing the combined minimum number of dice showing a particular face that have been rolled by both players. For example, if a player says \"two threes,\" they are betting that between both players, two or more threes have been rolled. The opposing player may then either \"raise\" the bet, in which case they counter with a new bet, or they may \"call\" the bet, in which case both players reveal their dice to see if the last bet was correct. When a bet is called, if the bet turned out to be incorrect, the betting player loses one of their dice. If the bet turned out to be correct, the calling player loses one of their dice. The rounds repeat until one player no longer has any dice.</p><h3>Rolling Dice</h3><p>Players should roll their dice privately in Foundry so that their opponent cannot see the rolls until a bet is called. After rolling dice, a player can click on their roll card in the chat log to see the individual results of each roll. The following buttons can be used as roll shortcuts:</p><p>5 dice: [[/sr 5d4]]<br />4 dice: [[/sr 4d4]]<br />3 dice: [[/sr 3d4]]<br />2 dice: [[/sr 2d4]]<br />1 die: [[/sr 1d4]]</p><h3>Raising a Bet</h3><p>When raising a bet, the raised bet must include a higher quantity of dice or the same quantity of dice with a greater face value. For example, if the previous bet was \"two threes,\" a raised bet could be \"two fours,\" \"three ones,\" or even \"six twos,\" but not \"two twos\" or \"one four.\"</p><h3>Calling a Bet</h3><p>When a bet is called, both players must reveal their dice (right-click on your roll in Foundry and choose the \"Reveal to Everyone\" option. The players then check to see if the combined dice have faces greater than or equal to the called bet. For example, if the called bet was \"two twos\" and there are three twos among both players, the bet is correct, but if there is only one two, the bet is incorrect. If the called bet is incorrect, the betting player loses a die. If the called bet is correct, the calling player loses a die.</p><h3>Ending the Game</h3><p>The game ends when one player no longer has any dice.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.nTK5DILsM18H4eOP.JournalEntryPage.4Zv9b9W2xis4eu4O"}}},{"sort":400000,"name":"Taltain Finale","type":"text","_id":"XsZXv1DAyCYQ2yBc","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<h2>Taltain Finale: The Council of Taltain</h2><h3>Hook</h3><p>On its surface, Taltain appeared to be a city untouched by the Cataclysm, but the adventurers of Covalon were not so easily deceived. Behind the wooden masks of Taltain's citizenry hid aberrations connected to a hivemind that instructed them to imitate the former civilization. Though it's still not clear why the aberrations were doing this, the Covalonians uncovered their enabler - a Vessel of the Maw, kept under guard by the city's twisted councilors in a building called the Quinate. Though the Vessel has been destroyed, the Seed transplanted in the Quinate still needs rotating shifts of guards be protected it from the facsimiles of the councilors that appear on its doorstep.</p><h3>Conflict in the Quinate</h3><p>The Maw is aware that its Vessel in Taltain has been destroyed, and it is not content to take the loss without retaliation. Facsimiles of the Taltain councilors have appeared in Taltain, but engaging them among the people in the city is a certain death sentence. They need to be fought in a location away from the eyes and ears of the rest of the city, and it just so happens that the Quinate serves as the perfect battleground.</p><p>The PCs begin near the councilors' chairs at the north end of the map, while the five councilors start at the southern end of the map. The doors behind the councilors swing shut as they enter, and they will refuse to retreat or use the outside hallway during the fight. The platform at the north end of the room featuring the chairs is only a foot high and can be reached from the ground as part of a Stride, Step, or any other normal move action without being considered difficult terrain. The ceiling is a dome, but for ease of play, it should be treated as 30 feet high in all areas. The six pillars in the Quinate extend from the floor to the ceiling, providing cover and blocking line of effect like normal terrain. The PCs are serving a full guard shift as part of this adventure, so they won't have sufficient advance notice of when the facsimiles of the councilors arrive to use abilities or items that grant short-term beneficial effects (though anything with a duration of 8 hours or longer can be used).</p><p>If the GM has not done so yet, they should select one of the three Modifications to apply (found on The Assembled Council of Taltain's statblock) or roll [[/r 1d3]] to determine one randomly. Do not tell the players which Modification is in effect. (For Hard Mode, use all 3 modifications.) Note: The modifications only apply to The Assembled Council of Taltain; any abilities or effects they grant are not applied to the individual councilors.</p><p>Should the PCs need to escape from the encounter, they can do by spending one action to open one of the doors at the south end of the arena and then moving south of them. Players may not fight from outside the building; any PC that moves past the doors should be removed from the encounter and is considered to have escaped.</p><h3>Tactics Overview</h3><p>The fight begins with the players facing off against the five councilors of Taltain. They each have unique abilities, but their tactics are mostly straightforward.</p><ul><li>Belle prefers to stay close to enemy spellcasters so she can interrupt them with Not Your Line!. She should focus on using her reach to trip enemy spellcasters or problematic enemies, and if she's in range of an ally, she can also use Whip into Shape! to make efficient use of an action instead of spending it on a third attack roll.</li><li>Carloni uses her Thunder-Thrower to target enemies that her fellow councilors are attacking while she uses Battle Graft to nimbly \"heal\" her allies. If the opportunity presents itself to where she can hit a decent number of allies and/or enemies with Ultravolt!, she should take it, especially if it can also hit a pillar.</li><li>Darkscale should use Agitating Shadows immediately upon his first turn to sow chaos among the PCs. Although the other councilors will also be affected by the sight limit form this ability, they can use the darkness to reach opportune positions for future turns. Aside from that, he can use Shadow Jump to quickly travel the battlefield and his powerful Strikes to inflict large amounts of damage on high-priority targets.</li><li>Ferdi should try to use Hunt Heretic every turn, if possible. His Hatred of Heretics ability requires him to focus on attacking creatures with visible symbols of deity, and the 100 ft. range of his rifle will allow him to do so in most circumstances. While Agitating Shadows is in effect, Ferdi can use Chameleon Skin to become undetected to the PCs, and he can also use it before using Hunt Heretic to make his target flat-footed.</li><li>Oster should attempt to use his Mega Bomb when he can hit as many PCs as possible without hitting any of his allies; if he rolls well on initiative, his first turn is opportune for this. His Pyromaniac ability gives his HP some significant heft, so he shouldn't be adverse to fighting on the front lines.</li></ul><p>Once two councilors are defeated, the Coagulating Council ability triggers and The Assembled Council of Taltain appears. The Assembled Council's beginning position is to the GM's discretion, but should be somewhere close to the center of the Quinate. Instead of rolling initiative, it gets slotted in at the position of the councilor who as next up in the initiative order when Coagulating Council was triggered.</p><p>At the end of each of its turns, the Assembled Council triggers Shifting Form. The GM should always give a brief description of which form the Assembled Council is entering - and for Gun Arm Form in particular, the GM should be sure to announce which PC is the target of the Assembled Council's focus (when the Tricky Form Modification is enabled, be sure to hint at the tricked form instead, including a target if Gun Arm Form is the tricked form). The ability granted by the selected form should be used as the first action(s) of the Assembled Council's next turn, if possible. Here are some specific details for each form:</p><ul><li>Bomber Form is simple. When the Assembled Council's turn next comes up, they should use Mega-Bomb Barrage as their first actions. (Allowing them to Stride first prevents the PCs from appropriately using the pillars to counter the ability.)</li><li>Gun Arm Form should use Arm Cannon as their first actions on their next turn as well. The line for this ability can originate from any of the Assembled Council's squares.</li><li>Duelist Form causes the Assembled Council to enter Duelist Dance immediately, meaning they can use their new reactions before their next turn. They can use one reaction on every creature's turn, plus one additional reaction before their next turn, meaning that one particularly unlucky creature could receive two of the Assembled Council's reactions while in this form.</li><li>Shadowcaller Form uses Swirling Darkness immediately, but the effects have an important order to them. First, any creature <em>farther</em> than 10 feet away from the Assembled Council must make the required Will save; creatures 10 feet away or closer to the Assembled Council automatically succeed. Afterwards, the Assembled Council can teleport 60 feet. The teleport must occur <em>after</em> the Will saves, as the players should be guaranteed to avoid the effect if they use their turn to move within 10 feet of the Assembled Council.</li><li>Mad Scientist Form should use OMEGAVOLT! as their first actions on their next turn. It is best to switch to this form when enemies are close to the pillars, such as after using Bomber Form. The red squares on the arena designate the 10 foot emanations around each pillar - these can be seen by the GM but are hidden to the players.</li></ul><p>If the Flesh Pods Modification is enabled, the Assembled Council should direct their minions to harry hard-to-reach enemies, or they can be used to provide flanking for the Assembled Council's attacks in addition to using their other abilities. If the Destablisiation Modification is in play, it can be used to punish PCs that hug too close together, such as if they attempt to mititgate damage being dealt to an Arm Cannon target.</p><h3>Loot</h3><p>The entirety of the treasure budget is given out in raw GP, paid by the NPC used for the hook. Additionally, players unlock the ability to customize their Soul Seed, gaining access to the Soul aspect.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.3.4","coreVersion":"10.288","createdTime":1668017705812,"modifiedTime":1668019836965,"lastModifiedBy":"GlvvIehDY7BHTmwu"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"GlvvIehDY7BHTmwu":3}}
