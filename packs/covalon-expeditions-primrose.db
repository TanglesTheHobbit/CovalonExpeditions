Despite their victory, however, the corrupting influence of the Maw remains a significant threat to the sapling housed in a secret chamber behind the statues. Luckily we have enough favour with the local Shahs to keep the fighting outside of the palace while we deal with this fresh fascimile!</p>\n<h3>Assault on the Palace</h3>\n<p>In an attempt to crush the growing sapling, the Maw has created a Facsimile of Saddam Syed, the Sultan of the Sky and has sent it to assault the palace and destroy the Seed of Terra. Covalon's scouts have determined that the attack will take place at any moment, so Covalon's finest must be ready to defend the sapling at all costs! </p>\n<p>The PCs begin near the pillows in the centre of the room, with Saddam Syed starting at the southern entrance. Generally speaking, Saddam Syed prefers to walk upon the ground rather than fly and hover, but he will utilise his extended mobility to escape barriers and blockages he might find between him and his quarry. The encounter is more interesting when Saddam Syed does not need to spend actions hovering. </p>\n<p>If the GM has not already done so, they should select one of the three Modifications to apply, or roll [[/r 1d3]] to determine one randomly. Do not tell the players which modification is in effect prior to the session. For Hard Mode, use all three modifications. </p>\n<p>If the players need to escape from the encounter, they can do so by running out of the southern entrance. </p>\n<p>Players should only be permitted to pre-cast buffs that have a duration of 8+ hours. </p>\n<h3>Tactics Overview</h3>\n<p>Saddam Syed is arrogant and self-righteous, but does not underestimate the party. He should be played intelligently, and use his abilities to their maximum effect where possible. As his health decreases, he should become more and more desperate for victory until he eventually uses <strong>Three Wishes</strong>. </p>\n<p>The crystal elemental should make as much distance between itself and the party as possible and then throw rocks at them. You can hint that it is connected to Al-Kujani, but try not to give it away immediately. </p>\n<p>Keep in mind that Saddam's <strong>Fist</strong> attack and <strong>Sudden Squall</strong> both have the Air trait, which triggers weakness from <strong>Return to Dust.</strong> </p>\n<p>Al-Kujani should be unbothered by friendly fire on the water elemental from <strong>Vizier of Waves</strong>. It will be replaced anyway. </p>\n<h3>Loot</h3>\n<p><span style=\"color:#1c1c1c;font-size:15.6px\">The entirety of the treasure budget is given out in raw GP, paid by the NPC used for the hook. Additionally, players unlock the ability to customize their Soul Seed, gaining access to the Air aspect.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"GlvvIehDY7BHTmwu":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.CvvB7rzHrbQPiC5E"}}}

While it isn't entirely clear why they're assisting, they've helped adventurers sneak into the city and given them crucial information for navigating Duneveil. A Shah is now calling in a favor, and it would be unwise for the Covalonians to refuse.</p>\n<h3>Required Elements</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Servants belonging to one of the city's many Shahs smuggle the party into the city, through the streets and to their master's manor. An arrogant minor Shah (LE geniekin magus; see: Roleplaying the Shah) asks the party to recover documents from the home of a political rival and provides them with an explosive barrel for infiltration purposes (see: Noisy Infiltration).</li>\n<li>The Shah instructs the party to use shaded alleys to reach the rival's residence and the sewers to escape the same. Choose to have the first encounter occur either during the alleys leading up to the manor or in the sewers afterwards. This accounts for one third of the adventure XP budget.</li>\n<li>The players enter the rival's residence in the manner described in the Noisy Infiltration section and do combat with the rival's guards. This accounts for one third of the adventure XP Budget.</li>\n<li>After their explosive entry, the players have a short window to rifle through documents. This chase scene accounts for a third of the adventure XP budget and determines whether the party learns a secret (see: Smash and Grab).</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Roleplaying the Shah</h3>\n<p>The Shah is a minor noble in Duneveil looking to elevate his status by using the PCs to undermine his rivals. The Shah used in this adventure can be a janni, djinni, shaitan, efreeti, or marid, and can be any gender (though this document uses a singular set of pronouns for clarity purposes).</p>\n<p>The Shah is arrogant, and though he understands the advantages the party can procure, he considers them beneath his notice. The Shah tells the players of the route they will take to and from the rival's residence and provides them with an explosive barrel. He explains the barrel's nature but provides no other information, including about its safe activation, unless asked. Even then, he takes affront at the effort he must make and will answer only three questions, though adventurers can extract additional answers with a successful <strong>#DC+2# Diplomacy check</strong>.<strong> </strong></p>\n<p>His answers to pertinent questions provide the players with useful information and/or mechanical effects used later in the adventure, as shown in the table below.

{"_id":"VbP1fibWGeqhUP2N","name":"Primrose Briefing","content":"<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>Once known as \"the great oasis,\" Primrose has been reduced to little more than a handful of sand-tarnished domes sticking up out of the dunes. Far below Primrose, however, another city thrives - the legendary city of Duneveil.</p>\n<p>Long ago, Duneveil ruled the desert on the western continent, with a long line of pharaohs ensuring generations of prosperity. But as technology progressed and society flourished, each new pharaoh found it difficult to create a legacy as impressive as the one that came before them. The last pharaoh of Duneveil found the task insurmountable, and included that the only way for him to leave a lasting legacy was to achieve eternal life. Consumed by this obsession, Duneveil poured all of its research into the necromatic arts until a catastrophic accident occurred and Duneveil disappeared overnight.</p>\n<p>Eventually, Primrose was founded on top of the sands that had swallowed Duneveil - though this fact was completely unknown to the new nation's founders. There were no records of Duneveil having existed at all, aside from the ravings of sun-touched madmen who claimed to have seen a \"mirage city\" while wandering the desert that went on to become the subject of children's stories and wives' tales. In reality, the city was still alive - or rather, <em>undead </em>- deep under Primrose's labyrinthine sewers, still quietly researching a method in which the pharaoh could achieve eternal life. But that day would never come.</p>\n<p>The most powerful oligarchs in Primrose, known as the Shahs, learned about the advent of the Cataclysm the day before it reached their city. Taking as much of their wealth and household guard as they could, they secreted themselves in the Ratways, narrowly avoiding the enviornmental destruction that washed over the city's surface. As they searched for a way out, they made two incredible discoveries. The first was the legendary \"mirage city,\" and the second was a cache of incredible elemental power, which they harnessed in order to bring Duneveil and its pharaoh to its knees. Now, Duneveil is caught in a territory war between the former Shahs of Primrose, but their ambitions don't end with eternal life. One of the Shahs has crowned himself sultan, and deigns to raise armies of both elementals and undead in order to claim the entirety of the surface world as his domain.</p>\n<p>For more information on Primrose, see its entry in the <a href=\"https://scribe.pf2.tools/v/8vMfPSF7-covalon-player-s-guide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Covalon Player's Guide</a>.</p>\n<h2>Mission Overview</h2>\n<p>After a hot, tumultuous, and rocky journey of traveling underneath the sands of the desert, the Covalonians had been looking forward to piloting the <em>Oasis-Seeker</em> to Primrose in order to explore the areas of the city left untouched by the Cataclysm's natural disasters. But to the surprise of the adventurers, the sand diver instead dug into a massive underground cavern. From the cliff they were perched upon, the Covalonians could look down and see a sprawling metropolis that defied explanation. Consulting with Covalon's most esteemed historical scholars turned up no relevant information, but the bards and masters of folklore understood that their discovery could only be one thing - the \"mirage city\" mentioned in children's fables - the lost city of Duneveil.</p>\n<p>The Covalonians' approach did not go unnoticed by the residents of the city, but in a twist of fate, their first encounter with a post-Cataclysm civilization didn't result in violence. An emissary by the name of Al-Fazim Khalid (LE female efreeti) recognized the colors of Covalon and approached the camp by flight. She explained that she had been helped by adventurers from Covalon in the past, and was interested in returning the favor in exchange for continued partnership for furthering her own ambitions.</p>\n<p>Al-Fazim explained that the other Shahs of Primrose were warned of the impending Cataclysm and fled the city a day in advance by way of the Ratways - the sprawling sewers underneath Primrose. They were led by a mysterious man who was allegedly one of Duneveil's lesser-known Shahs, who told them he needed their help in commandeeering a legendary city beneath the earth. In addition to his powers of foresight, this man shared with the Shahs incredible elemental power, transforming them into geniekin in order to assist him in conquering Duneveil from its undead pharaohs.</p>\n<p>Since then, Duneveil has been a city filled with political instability and strife. Although the mysterious man who formerly led the Shahs has declared himself sultan, he does little to stop the other Shahs from warring over territory within the city. His ambitions are much greater - he wants to raise an army of elementals and undead to conquer the surface world.</p>\n<p>Before leaving, Al-Fazim provided the Covalonians with contact information of various Shahs within the city who would be interested in supporting the amibitions of the expeditionary force in return for favors to support their own. While many details about Duneveil's sultan and the Shahs' ambitions remain unclear, the council of Covalon is certain of one thing - the Seed of Terra has led them to here to destroy another Vessel of the Maw.</p>\n<h2>How to Run an Expedition</h2>\n<p>Expeditions are composed of two subtypes: missions and finales. Missions are a set of three dungeon-like adventures that are narratively linked, but can be completed in any order. Each mission must include predetermined narrative and mechanical elements while sticking to a theme of locations, creatures, and loot, which are included in its associated journal entry, with the specifics of the blanks to be filled in by the GM of the adventure. Like other adventure types, Dungeon Guides must submit their expedition missions for approval.</p>\n<p>When reading the instructions for an expedition, you may see key terms surrounded by number signs. These indicate that the term should be replaced by a value that's dependent on the adventure's average party level.  If you have any questions about how to apply these terms or any of the required elements, be sure to ask about them during your submission for approval. Here is a list of terms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>#Creature [Table Number] [Modifier]#</strong> should be replaced by a value according to a table in the <a href=\"https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=995\">Building Creatures</a> section of the Gamemastery Guide. For example, \"#Creature 2-8 Minimum# means that you should reference the Building Creatures rules, look for Table 2-8, and use the value in the Minimum column for the creature's level (adjusted for elite or weak as appropriate).</li>\n<li><strong>#Hazard [Table Number] [Modifier]# </strong>should be replaced by a value according to a table in the <a href=\"https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=1043\">Building Hazards</a> section of the Gamemastery Guide. For example, \"#Hazard 2-16 Simple Damage# means that you should reference the Building Hazards rules, look for table 2-16, and use the value in the Simple Damage column for the hazard's level.</li>\n<li><strong>#DC [Modifier]# </strong>should be replaced by a value according to the <a href=\"https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=554\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DCs by Level</a> table in the Core Rulebook. If a modifier is included, the value should be adjusted accordingly. For example, \"#DC +5#\" means that you should reference the DCs by Level table, find the value appropriate for the party's average level, then add 5 to it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Finales are singular encounters against a narratively significant threat that conclude an expedition. They come in two versions: normal mode and hard mode. Before a finale is cleared for the first time, it can only be run by Covalon administrators and moderators, and is ran at hard mode. Afterwards, the finale can be ran by any Dungeon Guide at normal mode (though players can request hard mode if they'd like). Normal mode can be run in Tier 2 or above, and hard mode can only be run at the highest tier, intended for max level characters. Unlike missions, finales use a specific map and specific creatures, included with this module.</p>\n<p>Each finale comes with three variant modifications. When running a normal mode finale, a GM choose one of the three modifications to use, or can roll [[/r 1d3]] to randomly determine which modification to use. When running a hard mode finale, the GM uses all three modifications. There are no additional rewards for completing hard mode.</p>\n<h2>Reporting a Completed Expedition</h2>\n<p>When reporting a completed expedition in the Dungeon Summaries channel, use the <strong>exact name</strong> of the adventure as the adventure's title. For example, if you ran the first mission of Ikouga, the summary's title should be \"Ikouga Mission A: Retame the Island\" exactly. The summary should otherwise follow the same format as dungeons. <strong>Please be aware that although these adventures take place in Duneveil, the official adventure titles should still be referred to as \"Primrose\" missions.</strong></p>\n<p>Finally, any narrative-based knowledge or intrigue that the players gain as a result of the expedition should be left out of the summary. For example, if the players complete a bonus objective that allows them to learn special information as detailed in the Required Elements or Recommended Loot section of each journal entry, that should be left out of the dungeon summary.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"7RtLbrlfn9D7fL4K":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.covalon-expeditions.covalon-expeditions-primrose.VbP1fibWGeqhUP2N"}}}
