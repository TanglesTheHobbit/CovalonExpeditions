Missions are a set of three dungeon-like adventures that are narratively linked, but can be completed in any order. Each mission must include predetermined narrative and mechanical elements while sticking to a theme of locations, creatures, and loot, which are included in its associated journal entry, with the specifics of the blanks to be filled in by the GM of the adventure. Like other adventure types, Dungeon Guides must submit their expedition missions for approval.</p><p>When reading the instructions for an expedition, you may see key terms surrounded by number signs. These indicate that the term should be replaced by a value that's dependent on the adventure's average party level. When submitting your expedition for approval, you must include the values you plan to replace these terms with. Here is a list of terms:</p><ul><li><strong>#Creature [Table Number] [Modifier]#</strong> should be replaced by a value according to a table in the <a href=\"https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=995\">Building Creatures</a> section of the Gamemastery Guide. For example, \"#Creature 2-8 Minimum# means that you should reference the Building Creatures rules, look for Table 2-8, and use the value in the Minimum column for the creature's level (adjusted for elite or weak as appropriate).</li><li><strong>#Hazard [Table Number] [Modifier]# </strong>should be replaced by a value according to a table in the <a href=\"https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=1043\">Building Hazards</a> section of the Gamemastery Guide. For example, \"#Hazard 2-16 Simple Damage# means that you should reference the Building Hazards rules, look for table 2-16, and use the value in the Simple Damage column for the hazard's level.</li><li><strong>#DC [Modifier]# </strong>should be replaced by a value according to the <a href=\"https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=554\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DCs by Level</a> table in the Core Rulebook. If a modifier is included, the value should be adjusted accordingly. For example, \"#DC +5#\" means that you should reference the DCs by Level table, find the value appropriate for the party's average level, then add 5 to it.</li></ul><p>Finales are singular encounters against a narratively significant threat that conclude an expedition. They come in two versions: normal mode and hard mode. Before a finale is cleared for the first time, it can only be run by Covalon administrators and moderators, and is ran at hard mode. Afterwards, the finale can be ran by any Dungeon Guide at normal mode (though players can request hard mode if they'd like). Normal mode can be run in Tier 2 or above, and hard mode can only be run at the highest tier, intended for max level characters. Unlike missions, finales use a specific map and specific creatures, included with this module.</p><p>Each finale comes with three variant modifications. When running a normal mode finale, a GM choose one of the three modifications to use, or can roll [[/r 1d3]] to randomly determine which modification to use. When running a hard mode finale, the GM uses all three modifications. There are no additional rewards for completing hard mode.</p><h2>Reporting a Completed Expedition</h2><p>When reporting a completed expedition in the Dungeon Summaries channel, use the <strong>exact name</strong> of the adventure as the adventure's title. For example, if you ran the first mission of Pudersnö, the summary's title should be \"<span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Pudersnö Mission A: Lightning Tamer</span>\" exactly. The summary should otherwise follow the same format as dungeons.</p><p>Finally, any narrative-based knowledge or intrigue that the players gain as a result of the expedition should be left out of the summary.

A mighty Mpeshi has taken residence at the top of the mountain and seems to be acting strangely! It wears a strange crown and each time we strike it down a new one takes its place. Nevertheless, we must continue to defend Covalon's stake in Pudersnö.</p><p></p><h2>Hoofin' It</h2><p>In an attempt to destroy the growing sapling, the Maw has recreated its cursed crown and bolstered the Mpeshi King with a directive to destroy the Seed of Terra. Our scouts have identified that a new facsimile has come, so we need to take action as soon as possible before the storms get unbearable! Preparing the cannons can take a while, so players may only use pre-buffing spells that last 8 hours or longer.</p><p>As part of their preparations, players are loaded into a definitely-very-safe cannon designed by the greatest minds Covalon can muster. In fact, to ensure a safe landing they are being loaded with a bed to ensure a safe landing! How thoughtful!</p><p>The PCs begin on the broken bed in the Pudersno Summit map. The Mpeshi King starts on its hay bed in the north of the map, flanked by two Goat Swarms. If the Horned Glyph modification is in use, it is active in the centre of the map. The Mpeshi King, Goat Swarm and Horned Glyph (if it is present) roll initiative separately.</p><h2>Baa-aahd News</h2><p>The Mpeshi King is a territorial and dangerous creature, and attempts to destroy any invaders to its mountaintop throne.</p><p>The Mpeshi King prioritises the use of <strong>Sleipner Breaker</strong>, striking two creatures as often as it can with its <strong>King's Horns</strong> strike. As this deals lightning damage, it activates <strong>Thunder Aura</strong>, reminding creatures why the King is not to be trifled with. If the modification is active, the Mpeshi King uses <strong>Baaah of Ages</strong> as often as it can, hitting as many creatures as possible.</p><p>Defensively, the Mpeshi King demands the utmost from its subjects, defending itself from damage with <strong>Long Live The King.</strong> Players are incentivised to either burst down the King, or defeat its subjects to avoid splitting their damage too much. The Mpeshi King always uses <strong>Royal Decree</strong> to ensure use of its defensive reaction every turn, and will change between using <strong>Long Live The King </strong>and <strong>Tail of Opportunity</strong> depending on the situation.</p><p>Upon reaching half hitpoints, the Mpeshi King immediately uses <strong>The Second Crucible of Capra Rex</strong>, becoming untargetable until the start of its next turn. After appropriate narrative and resolving the required Reflex saves, place the <strong>Metal Shards</strong> loot actor in the centre of the map and inform players of the club-shaped metal protruding from the ground.
