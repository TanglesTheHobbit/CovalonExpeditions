Luckily, our heroes are not stranded - just before the journey began, the Heart of Terra produced a Seed and instructed adventurers to plant it in Ikouga. By doing so and performing a special ritual, the magical connection between the Seed and the Heart manifested into a permanent portal that allows instantaneous access between Covalon and the base camp at Ikouga. <em>The North Star</em> must be repaired before expeditions can continue, but we need to secure our camp in the meantime, and it might not hurt to explore the city and see what's been left behind.</p>\n<h2>How to Run an Expedition</h2>\n<p>Expeditions are composed of two subtypes: missions and finales. Missions are a set of three dungeon-like adventures that are narratively linked, but can be completed in any order. Each mission must include predetermined narrative and mechanical elements while sticking to a theme of locations, creatures, and loot, which are included in its associated journal entry, with the specifics of the blanks to be filled in by the GM of the adventure. Like other adventure types, Dungeon Guides must submit their expedition missions for approval.</p>\n<p>When reading the instructions for an expedition, you may see key terms surrounded by number signs. These indicate that the term should be replaced by a value that's dependent on the adventure's average party level. When submitting your expedition for approval, you must include the values you plan to replace these terms with. Here is a list of terms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>#Creature [Table Number] [Modifier]#</strong> should be replaced by a value according to a table in the <a href=\"https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=995\">Building Creatures</a> section of the Gamemastery Guide. For example, \"#Creature 2-8 Minimum# means that you should reference the Building Creatures rules, look for Table 2-8, and use the value in the Minimum column for the creature's level (adjusted for elite or weak as appropriate).</li>\n<li><strong>#Hazard [Table Number] [Modifier]# </strong>should be replaced by a value according to a table in the <a href=\"https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=1043\">Building Hazards</a> section of the Gamemastery Guide. For example, \"#Hazard 2-16 Simple Damage# means that you should reference the Building Hazards rules, look for table 2-16, and use the value in the Simple Damage column for the hazard's level.</li>\n<li><strong>#DC [Modifier]# </strong>should be replaced by a value according to the <a href=\"https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=554\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DCs by Level</a> table in the Core Rulebook. If a modifier is included, the value should be adjusted accordingly. For example, \"#DC +5#\" means that you should reference the DCs by Level table, find the value appropriate for the party's average level, then add 5 to it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Finales are singular encounters against a narratively significant threat that conclude an expedition. They come in two versions: normal mode and hard mode. Before a finale is cleared for the first time, it can only be run by Covalon administrators and moderators, and is ran at hard mode. Afterwards, the finale can be ran by any Dungeon Guide at normal mode (though players can request hard mode if they'd like). Normal mode can be run in Tier 2 or above, and hard mode can only be run at the highest tier, intended for max level characters. Unlike missions, finales use a specific map and specific creatures, included with this module.</p>\n<p>Each finale comes with three variant modifications. When running a normal mode finale, a GM choose one of the three modifications to use, or can roll [[/r 1d3]] to randomly determine which modification to use. When running a hard mode finale, the GM uses all three modifications. There are no additional rewards for completing hard mode.</p>\n<h2>Reporting a Completed Expedition</h2>\n<p>When reporting a completed expedition in the Dungeon Summaries channel, use the <strong>exact name</strong> of the adventure as the adventure's title. For example, if you ran the first mission of Ikouga, the summary's title should be \"Ikouga Mission A: Retame the Island\" exactly. The summary should otherwise follow the same format as dungeons.</p>\n<p>Finally, any narrative-based knowledge or intrigue that the players gain as a result of the expedition should be left out of the summary. For example, if the players complete a bonus objective that allows them to learn special information as detailed in the Required Elements or Recommended Loot section of each journal entry, that should be left out of the dungeon summary.</p>"},"_id":"bYsPPp2MGTF9qX7v","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":100000,"name":"Ikouga Mission A: Retame the Island","type":"text","_id":"BpbJXQW2Ylf32KnR","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<h2>Ikouga Mission A: Retame the Island</h2><h3>Hook</h3><p>Since Ikouga was abandoned, nature has slowly started to reclaim the island, but the local flora and fauna are different from what's written about in Ikougan history books.

In time, Ikouga's technology grew and urban development expanded, with the city encompassing more and more of the original island with every passing year. A bustling sea port filled with experience sailors traveled to other islands to harvest more resources, further increasing the city's abundance, until the city expanded to the point where the entire original island had been covered by city - no original tropical forest remained.</p>\n<p>One day, the wind suddenly stopped in Ikouga. As a city dependent on resources from other islands, it quickly fell into chaos and anarchy. While victims of the Cataclysm in other corners of the world more commonly died to monster attacks, citizens of Ikouga passed due to civil violence or starvation. Some managed to escape by rowing, but most who tried to cross the ocean perished, either from running out of supplies during the journey or - in rare cases - being attacked by a sea monster.</p>\n<p>For more information on Ikouga, see its entry in the <a href=\"https://scribe.pf2.tools/v/8vMfPSF7-covalon-player-s-guide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Covalon Player's Guide</a>.</p>\n<h2>Mission Overview</h2>\n<p>On the path to searching for the external sources of the Heart of the Maw's power, Covalon has sailed to Ikouga on a galley named <em>The North Star</em> with the goal of establishing a naval base of operations from which they can explore the rest of the world. On the last leg of the journey, disaster struck - an unknown creature from beneath the waves ransacked the ship, causing it to run aground on the shore of Ikouga and causing significant damage. Luckily, our heroes are not stranded - just before the journey began, the Heart of Terra produced a Seed and instructed adventurers to plant it in Ikouga. By doing so and performing a special ritual, the magical connection between the Seed and the Heart manifested into a permanent portal that allows instantaneous access between Covalon and the base camp at Ikouga. <em>The North Star</em> must be repaired before expeditions can continue, but we need to secure our camp in the meantime, and it might not hurt to explore the city and see what's been left behind.</p>\n<h2>How to Run an Expedition</h2>\n<p>Expeditions are composed of two subtypes: missions and finales. Missions are a set of three dungeon-like adventures that are narratively linked, but can be completed in any order. Each mission must include predetermined narrative and mechanical elements while sticking to a theme of locations, creatures, and loot, which are included in its associated journal entry, with the specifics of the blanks to be filled in by the GM of the adventure. Like other adventure types, Dungeon Guides must submit their expedition missions for approval.</p>\n<p>When reading the instructions for an expedition, you may see key terms surrounded by number signs. These indicate that the term should be replaced by a value that's dependent on the adventure's average party level. When submitting your expedition for approval, you must include the values you plan to replace these terms with. Here is a list of terms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>#Creature [Table Number] [Modifier]#</strong> should be replaced by a value according to a table in the <a href=\"https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=995\">Building Creatures</a> section of the Gamemastery Guide. For example, \"#Creature 2-8 Minimum# means that you should reference the Building Creatures rules, look for Table 2-8, and use the value in the Minimum column for the creature's level (adjusted for elite or weak as appropriate).</li>\n<li><strong>#Hazard [Table Number] [Modifier]# </strong>should be replaced by a value according to a table in the <a href=\"https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=1043\">Building Hazards</a> section of the Gamemastery Guide. For example, \"#Hazard 2-16 Simple Damage# means that you should reference the Building Hazards rules, look for table 2-16, and use the value in the Simple Damage column for the hazard's level.</li>\n<li><strong>#DC [Modifier]# </strong>should be replaced by a value according to the <a href=\"https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=554\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DCs by Level</a> table in the Core Rulebook. If a modifier is included, the value should be adjusted accordingly. For example, \"#DC +5#\" means that you should reference the DCs by Level table, find the value appropriate for the party's average level, then add 5 to it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Finales are singular encounters against a narratively significant threat that conclude an expedition. They come in two versions: normal mode and hard mode. Before a finale is cleared for the first time, it can only be run by Covalon administrators and moderators, and is ran at hard mode. Afterwards, the finale can be ran by any Dungeon Guide at normal mode (though players can request hard mode if they'd like). Normal mode can be run in Tier 2 or above, and hard mode can only be run at the highest tier, intended for max level characters. Unlike missions, finales use a specific map and specific creatures, included with this module.</p>\n<p>Each finale comes with three variant modifications. When running a normal mode finale, a GM choose one of the three modifications to use, or can roll [[/r 1d3]] to randomly determine which modification to use. When running a hard mode finale, the GM uses all three modifications. There are no additional rewards for completing hard mode.</p>\n<h2>Reporting a Completed Expedition</h2>\n<p>When reporting a completed expedition in the Dungeon Summaries channel, use the <strong>exact name</strong> of the adventure as the adventure's title. For example, if you ran the first mission of Ikouga, the summary's title should be \"Ikouga Mission A: Retame the Island\" exactly. The summary should otherwise follow the same format as dungeons.</p>\n<p>Finally, any narrative-based knowledge or intrigue that the players gain as a result of the expedition should be left out of the summary. For example, if the players complete a bonus objective that allows them to learn special information as detailed in the Required Elements or Recommended Loot section of each journal entry, that should be left out of the dungeon summary.</p>"},"_id":"bYsPPp2MGTF9qX7v","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":100000,"name":"Ikouga Mission A: Retame the Island","type":"text","_id":"BpbJXQW2Ylf32KnR","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<h2>Ikouga Mission A: Retame the Island</h2><h3>Hook</h3><p>Since Ikouga was abandoned, nature has slowly started to reclaim the island, but the local flora and fauna are different from what's written about in Ikougan history books.

Of particular interest is a skeleton clutching a magazine on Ikougan seafood that has a page ripped out.

Only one Victory Point can be obtained per skill challenge, even if both PCs attempting it succeed.</p><ul><li>Prepare the hides (Nature or Survival)</li><li>Break apart bones to access the infused marrow (Athletics)</li><li>Carefully remove monster organs (Medicine or Thievery)</li><li>Craft the suits (Crafting)</li><li>Make spooky noises to scare away the local wildlife to prevent work from being interrupted (Intimidation or Occultism)</li><li>Infuse the suits (Arcana or Religion)</li></ul><p>Depending on the amount of Victory Points earned, the diving suits grant effects to the party.</p><ul><li><strong>2 or fewer Victory Points </strong>The suits provide the effect of a water breathing spell for the duration of the adventure.</li><li><strong>3 Victory Points </strong>The suits provide a swim speed equal to half of the wearer's land speed and the effect of a water breathing spell for the duration of the adventure.</li><li><strong>4 or more Victory Points</strong><span style=\"font-family:var(--journal-serif)\"> </span>The suits provide acid resistance 10, a swim speed equal to the wearer's land speed, and the effect of a water breathing spell for the duration of the adventure.</li></ul><p>The diving suits do not require investment and can be worn over the PCs' other gear without restricting access to anything.</p><h3>Part 2: The Facsimile of Scylladon</h3><p>Scylladon has already been defeated, but the Maw's vengeance for the destruction of its Vessel has manifested as an imitation of the legendary creature. The PCs dive underwater to face off against a Facsimile of Scylladon and its tentacles.</p><p>The players begin at the south end of the map, on the ocean shelf, while Scylladon sits at the north end of the map, along with four tentacles that are randomly spread out around the arena, none of which should be adjacent to the starting positions of the PCs (hard mode can have up to two start adjacent to the PCs). Scylladon and its tentacles do not move during the encounter, with one exception: the tentacles may swim higher or lower in the water to reach a player that is above or below them.</p><p>If the GM has not done so yet, they should select one of the three Modifications to apply (found on Scylladon's statblock), or roll [[/r 1d3]] to determine one randomly. Do not tell the players which Modification is in effect. (For Hard Mode, use all 3 modifications.)</p><h3>Loot</h3><p>The entirety of the treasure budget is given out in raw GP, paid by the NPC used for the hook. Additionally, players unlock the ability to customize their Soul Seed, gaining access to the Water aspect.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.12.9","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1668017695366,"modifiedTime":1687630662580,"lastModifiedBy":"jKtQ3yoc8rnYa4Xt"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"GlvvIehDY7BHTmwu":3}}
