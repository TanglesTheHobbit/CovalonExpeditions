Nearly all other dragons look down on white dragons as hopelessly hotheaded and dull, though this does not make them any less dangerous-in fact, it may mean the opposite. It's nearly impossible to treat with white dragons, not because they lack the capacity to do so, but because they just don't care to. They are as difficult to deal with as they are quick to anger, and they become incensed at almost anything. When a white dragon does speak, it spews threats, inane jokes, and incoherent babbling as a prelude to attacking-and when the attack comes, it's bloody and relentless.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, white dragons prefer very cold, remote locations that are far from people. Dwelling on glacial mountaintops or in ice caverns beneath forbidding tundra, they treat the lands around them as their own personal hunting grounds. They fly out to feed or terrorize other creatures, especially those who trespass near the dragon's territory, then bring any treasure back to be displayed in icy niches in their lairs. They collect all kinds of valuables, with a slight preference for items with high utility-such as tools, trade goods, and fine food-over coins or jewels. The ability to shape ice lets white dragons rearrange their lairs exactly to their specifications, and they take great pride in how they've decorated their homes over the years.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>While there are many types of dragons, from the powerful planar dragons to the strange esoteric dragons, few dragon varieties are as well-known and as rightly feared as the chromatic dragons. Differentiated by the hue of their scales, each color of dragon unleashes its own flavor of murderous cruelty-be it by claw, tooth, or breath-and unlike most creatures, dragons only become more powerful as they age. Their lust for treasure, food, bloodshed, and control are legendary. Physically powerful with egos to match, these dragons are often morally depraved and act as criminal masterminds, vicious tyrants, or voracious raiders.</p>","privateNotes":""},"traits":{"senses":{"value":"darkvision, scent (imprecise) 60 feet, snow vision"},"traits":{"value":["cold","dragon"],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":["common","draconic"],"selected":[],"custom":""},"di":{"value":["cold","fire","paralyzed","sleep"],"custom":""},"dr":[],"dv":[],"rarity":"uncommon","size":{"value":"huge"},"ci":[]},"resources":{"focus":{"max":1,"value":1}},"schema":{"version":0.743,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-05-05T13:04:56.088-07:00","version":{"schema":0.738,"foundry":"9.269","system":"3.9.2.11293"}}},"abilities":{"str":{"mod":7,"value":24,"min":3},"dex":{"mod":3,"value":16,"min":3},"con":{"mod":7,"value":24,"min":3},"int":{"mod":3,"value":16,"min":3},"wis":{"mod":3,"value":16,"min":3},"cha":{"mod":3,"value":16,"min":3}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"value":22,"saveDetail":""},"reflex":{"value":19,"saveDetail":""},"will":{"value":16,"saveDetail":""}},"customModifiers":{}},"token":{"disposition":-1,"height":3,"img":"modules/covalon-expeditions/images/fjordcarver.Token.webp","name":"Facsimile of Fjordcarver","width":3,"displayName":30,"actorLink":false,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":true,"dimSight":500,"brightSight":500,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"color":null},"displayBars":30,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"flags":{"pf2e":{"linkToActorSize":true},"monks-little-details":{"token-highlight":""},"perfect-vision":{"visionRules":"default","monoVisionColor":"","sightLimit":null,"light":{}},"token-auras":{"aura1":{"permission":"all","colour":"#ffffff","opacity":0.5,"distance":null,"square":false},"aura2":{"permission":"all","colour":"#ffffff","opacity":0.5,"distance":null,"square":false}},"core":{}},"randomImg":false,"tint":null,"x":null,"y":null,"elevation":null},"items":[{"_id":"pmqefsGShf77p3Zd","data":{"description":{"value":""},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":["cold","magical","reach-15"],"rarity":"common","custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.743,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-05-05T13:04:56.088-07:00","version":{"schema":0.738,"foundry":"9.269","system":"3.9.2.11293"}}},"weaponType":{"value":"melee"},"attack":{"value":""},"damageRolls":{"v4enrkjx1vkly8li9k6n":{"damage":"2d10+9","damageType":"piercing"},"eh4ekj7akfeymny3g66q":{"damage":"2d6","damageType":"cold"}},"bonus":{"value":23,"total":23},"attackEffects":{"value":[],"custom":""}},"effects":[],"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/melee.svg","name":"Jaws","sort":400000,"type":"melee","folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"h6wQ76GXx0XhL0rW","data":{"description":{"value":""},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":["agile","magical","reach-10"],"rarity":"common","custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.743,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-05-05T13:04:56.088-07:00","version":{"schema":0.738,"foundry":"9.269","system":"3.9.2.11293"}}},"weaponType":{"value":"melee"},"attack":{"value":""},"damageRolls":{"vhvxp389ejd864a4xzoy":{"damage":"2d10+9","damageType":"slashing"}},"bonus":{"value":23,"total":23},"attackEffects":{"value":[],"custom":""}},"effects":[],"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/melee.svg","name":"Claw","sort":500000,"type":"melee","folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"b4GFgu6HgDqvji6X","data":{"description":{"value":""},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":["magical","reach-20"],"rarity":"common","custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.743,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-05-05T13:04:56.088-07:00","version":{"schema":0.738,"foundry":"9.269","system":"3.9.2.11293"}}},"weaponType":{"value":"melee"},"attack":{"value":""},"damageRolls":{"tisdqy7tmlrqju4fwo6r":{"damage":"2d12+9","damageType":"bludgeoning"}},"bonus":{"value":21,"total":21},"attackEffects":{"value":[],"custom":""}},"effects":[],"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/melee.svg","name":"Tail","sort":600000,"type":"melee","folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"y0vt5wkSLNErceZF","data":{"description":{"value":"<p data-visibility=\"gm\"><strong>Trigger</strong> An adjacent creature deals piercing or slashing damage to Fjordcarver.</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> Fjordcarver's blood sprays on the creature, dealing [[/r {2d6}[cold]]]{2d6 cold damage}.

Dwelling on glacial mountaintops or in ice caverns beneath forbidding tundra, they treat the lands around them as their own personal hunting grounds. They fly out to feed or terrorize other creatures, especially those who trespass near the dragon's territory, then bring any treasure back to be displayed in icy niches in their lairs. They collect all kinds of valuables, with a slight preference for items with high utility-such as tools, trade goods, and fine food-over coins or jewels. The ability to shape ice lets white dragons rearrange their lairs exactly to their specifications, and they take great pride in how they've decorated their homes over the years.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>While there are many types of dragons, from the powerful planar dragons to the strange esoteric dragons, few dragon varieties are as well-known and as rightly feared as the chromatic dragons. Differentiated by the hue of their scales, each color of dragon unleashes its own flavor of murderous cruelty-be it by claw, tooth, or breath-and unlike most creatures, dragons only become more powerful as they age. Their lust for treasure, food, bloodshed, and control are legendary. Physically powerful with egos to match, these dragons are often morally depraved and act as criminal masterminds, vicious tyrants, or voracious raiders.</p>","privateNotes":""},"traits":{"senses":{"value":"darkvision, scent (imprecise) 60 feet, snow vision"},"traits":{"value":["cold","dragon"],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":["common","draconic"],"selected":[],"custom":""},"di":{"value":["cold","fire","paralyzed","sleep"],"custom":""},"dr":[],"dv":[],"rarity":"uncommon","size":{"value":"huge"},"ci":[]},"resources":{"focus":{"max":1,"value":1}},"schema":{"version":0.743,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-05-05T13:04:56.088-07:00","version":{"schema":0.738,"foundry":"9.269","system":"3.9.2.11293"}}},"abilities":{"str":{"mod":6,"value":22,"min":3},"dex":{"mod":2,"value":14,"min":3},"con":{"mod":6,"value":22,"min":3},"int":{"mod":2,"value":14,"min":3},"wis":{"mod":2,"value":14,"min":3},"cha":{"mod":2,"value":14,"min":3}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"value":18,"saveDetail":""},"reflex":{"value":15,"saveDetail":""},"will":{"value":12,"saveDetail":""}},"customModifiers":{}},"token":{"disposition":-1,"height":3,"img":"modules/covalon-expeditions/images/fjordcarver.Token.webp","name":"Facsimile of Fjordcarver","width":3,"displayName":30,"actorLink":false,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":true,"dimSight":500,"brightSight":500,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"color":null},"displayBars":30,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"flags":{"pf2e":{"linkToActorSize":true},"monks-little-details":{"token-highlight":""},"perfect-vision":{"visionRules":"default","monoVisionColor":"","sightLimit":null,"light":{}},"token-auras":{"aura1":{"permission":"all","colour":"#ffffff","opacity":0.5,"distance":null,"square":false},"aura2":{"permission":"all","colour":"#ffffff","opacity":0.5,"distance":null,"square":false}},"core":{}},"randomImg":false,"tint":null,"x":null,"y":null,"elevation":null},"items":[{"_id":"pmqefsGShf77p3Zd","data":{"description":{"value":""},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":["cold","magical","reach-15"],"rarity":"common","custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.743,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-05-05T13:04:56.088-07:00","version":{"schema":0.738,"foundry":"9.269","system":"3.9.2.11293"}}},"weaponType":{"value":"melee"},"attack":{"value":""},"damageRolls":{"v4enrkjx1vkly8li9k6n":{"damage":"2d8+6","damageType":"piercing"},"eh4ekj7akfeymny3g66q":{"damage":"1d6","damageType":"cold"}},"bonus":{"value":18,"total":19},"attackEffects":{"value":[],"custom":""}},"effects":[],"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/melee.svg","name":"Jaws","sort":400000,"type":"melee","folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"h6wQ76GXx0XhL0rW","data":{"description":{"value":""},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":["agile","magical","reach-10"],"rarity":"common","custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.743,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-05-05T13:04:56.088-07:00","version":{"schema":0.738,"foundry":"9.269","system":"3.9.2.11293"}}},"weaponType":{"value":"melee"},"attack":{"value":""},"damageRolls":{"vhvxp389ejd864a4xzoy":{"damage":"2d8+6","damageType":"slashing"}},"bonus":{"value":18,"total":19},"attackEffects":{"value":[],"custom":""}},"effects":[],"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/melee.svg","name":"Claw","sort":500000,"type":"melee","folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"b4GFgu6HgDqvji6X","data":{"description":{"value":""},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":["magical","reach-20"],"rarity":"common","custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.743,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-05-05T13:04:56.088-07:00","version":{"schema":0.738,"foundry":"9.269","system":"3.9.2.11293"}}},"weaponType":{"value":"melee"},"attack":{"value":""},"damageRolls":{"tisdqy7tmlrqju4fwo6r":{"damage":"2d10+5","damageType":"bludgeoning"}},"bonus":{"value":16,"total":17},"attackEffects":{"value":[],"custom":""}},"effects":[],"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/melee.svg","name":"Tail","sort":600000,"type":"melee","folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"y0vt5wkSLNErceZF","data":{"description":{"value":"<p data-visibility=\"gm\"><strong>Trigger</strong> An adjacent creature deals piercing or slashing damage to Fjordcarver.</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> Fjordcarver's blood sprays on the creature, dealing [[/r {1d6}[cold]]]{1d6 cold damage}.

When a white dragon does speak, it spews threats, inane jokes, and incoherent babbling as a prelude to attacking-and when the attack comes, it's bloody and relentless.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, white dragons prefer very cold, remote locations that are far from people. Dwelling on glacial mountaintops or in ice caverns beneath forbidding tundra, they treat the lands around them as their own personal hunting grounds. They fly out to feed or terrorize other creatures, especially those who trespass near the dragon's territory, then bring any treasure back to be displayed in icy niches in their lairs. They collect all kinds of valuables, with a slight preference for items with high utility-such as tools, trade goods, and fine food-over coins or jewels. The ability to shape ice lets white dragons rearrange their lairs exactly to their specifications, and they take great pride in how they've decorated their homes over the years.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>While there are many types of dragons, from the powerful planar dragons to the strange esoteric dragons, few dragon varieties are as well-known and as rightly feared as the chromatic dragons. Differentiated by the hue of their scales, each color of dragon unleashes its own flavor of murderous cruelty-be it by claw, tooth, or breath-and unlike most creatures, dragons only become more powerful as they age. Their lust for treasure, food, bloodshed, and control are legendary. Physically powerful with egos to match, these dragons are often morally depraved and act as criminal masterminds, vicious tyrants, or voracious raiders.</p>","privateNotes":""},"traits":{"senses":{"value":"darkvision, scent (imprecise) 60 feet, snow vision"},"traits":{"value":["cold","dragon"],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":["common","draconic"],"selected":[],"custom":""},"di":{"value":["cold","fire","paralyzed","sleep"],"custom":""},"dr":[],"dv":[],"rarity":"uncommon","size":{"value":"huge"},"ci":[]},"resources":{"focus":{"max":1,"value":1}},"schema":{"version":0.743,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-05-05T13:04:56.089-07:00","version":{"schema":0.738,"foundry":"9.269","system":"3.9.2.11293"}}},"abilities":{"str":{"mod":8,"value":26,"min":3},"dex":{"mod":4,"value":16,"min":3},"con":{"mod":8,"value":20,"min":3},"int":{"mod":4,"value":14,"min":3},"wis":{"mod":4,"value":16,"min":3},"cha":{"mod":4,"value":14,"min":3}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"value":26,"saveDetail":""},"reflex":{"value":23,"saveDetail":""},"will":{"value":20,"saveDetail":""}},"customModifiers":{}},"token":{"disposition":-1,"height":3,"img":"modules/covalon-expeditions/images/fjordcarver.Token.webp","name":"Facsimile of Fjordcarver","width":3,"displayName":30,"actorLink":false,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":true,"dimSight":500,"brightSight":500,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"color":null},"displayBars":30,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"flags":{"pf2e":{"linkToActorSize":true},"monks-little-details":{"token-highlight":""},"perfect-vision":{"visionRules":"default","monoVisionColor":"","sightLimit":null,"light":{}},"token-auras":{"aura1":{"permission":"all","colour":"#ffffff","opacity":0.5,"distance":null,"square":false},"aura2":{"permission":"all","colour":"#ffffff","opacity":0.5,"distance":null,"square":false}},"core":{}},"randomImg":false,"tint":null,"x":null,"y":null,"elevation":null},"items":[{"_id":"pmqefsGShf77p3Zd","data":{"description":{"value":""},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":["cold","magical","reach-15"],"rarity":"common","custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.743,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-05-05T13:04:56.089-07:00","version":{"schema":0.738,"foundry":"9.269","system":"3.9.2.11293"}}},"weaponType":{"value":"melee"},"attack":{"value":""},"damageRolls":{"v4enrkjx1vkly8li9k6n":{"damage":"3d10+12","damageType":"piercing"},"eh4ekj7akfeymny3g66q":{"damage":"3d6","damageType":"cold"}},"bonus":{"value":27,"total":27},"attackEffects":{"value":[],"custom":""}},"effects":[],"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/melee.svg","name":"Jaws","sort":400000,"type":"melee","folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"h6wQ76GXx0XhL0rW","data":{"description":{"value":""},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":["agile","magical","reach-10"],"rarity":"common","custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.743,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-05-05T13:04:56.089-07:00","version":{"schema":0.738,"foundry":"9.269","system":"3.9.2.11293"}}},"weaponType":{"value":"melee"},"attack":{"value":""},"damageRolls":{"vhvxp389ejd864a4xzoy":{"damage":"3d10+12","damageType":"slashing"}},"bonus":{"value":27,"total":27},"attackEffects":{"value":[],"custom":""}},"effects":[],"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/melee.svg","name":"Claw","sort":500000,"type":"melee","folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"b4GFgu6HgDqvji6X","data":{"description":{"value":""},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":["magical","reach-20"],"rarity":"common","custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.743,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-05-05T13:04:56.089-07:00","version":{"schema":0.738,"foundry":"9.269","system":"3.9.2.11293"}}},"weaponType":{"value":"melee"},"attack":{"value":""},"damageRolls":{"tisdqy7tmlrqju4fwo6r":{"damage":"3d12+12","damageType":"bludgeoning"}},"bonus":{"value":25,"total":26},"attackEffects":{"value":[],"custom":""}},"effects":[],"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/melee.svg","name":"Tail","sort":600000,"type":"melee","folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"y0vt5wkSLNErceZF","data":{"description":{"value":"<p data-visibility=\"gm\"><strong>Trigger</strong> An adjacent creature deals piercing or slashing damage to Fjordcarver.</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> Fjordcarver's blood sprays on the creature, dealing [[/r {3d6}[cold]]]{3d6 cold damage}.

Nearly all other dragons look down on white dragons as hopelessly hotheaded and dull, though this does not make them any less dangerous-in fact, it may mean the opposite. It's nearly impossible to treat with white dragons, not because they lack the capacity to do so, but because they just don't care to. They are as difficult to deal with as they are quick to anger, and they become incensed at almost anything. When a white dragon does speak, it spews threats, inane jokes, and incoherent babbling as a prelude to attacking-and when the attack comes, it's bloody and relentless.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, white dragons prefer very cold, remote locations that are far from people. Dwelling on glacial mountaintops or in ice caverns beneath forbidding tundra, they treat the lands around them as their own personal hunting grounds. They fly out to feed or terrorize other creatures, especially those who trespass near the dragon's territory, then bring any treasure back to be displayed in icy niches in their lairs. They collect all kinds of valuables, with a slight preference for items with high utility-such as tools, trade goods, and fine food-over coins or jewels. The ability to shape ice lets white dragons rearrange their lairs exactly to their specifications, and they take great pride in how they've decorated their homes over the years.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>While there are many types of dragons, from the powerful planar dragons to the strange esoteric dragons, few dragon varieties are as well-known and as rightly feared as the chromatic dragons. Differentiated by the hue of their scales, each color of dragon unleashes its own flavor of murderous cruelty-be it by claw, tooth, or breath-and unlike most creatures, dragons only become more powerful as they age. Their lust for treasure, food, bloodshed, and control are legendary. Physically powerful with egos to match, these dragons are often morally depraved and act as criminal masterminds, vicious tyrants, or voracious raiders.</p>","privateNotes":""},"traits":{"senses":{"value":"darkvision, scent (imprecise) 60 feet, snow vision"},"traits":{"value":["cold","dragon"],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":["common","draconic"],"selected":[],"custom":""},"di":{"value":["cold","fire","paralyzed","sleep"],"custom":""},"dr":[],"dv":[],"rarity":"uncommon","size":{"value":"huge"},"ci":[]},"resources":{"focus":{"max":1,"value":1}},"schema":{"version":0.769,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-08-14T14:43:15.423-04:00","version":{"schema":0.743,"foundry":"9.269","system":"3.13.5.16"}}},"abilities":{"str":{"mod":9,"value":26,"min":3},"dex":{"mod":5,"value":16,"min":3},"con":{"mod":9,"value":20,"min":3},"int":{"mod":5,"value":14,"min":3},"wis":{"mod":5,"value":16,"min":3},"cha":{"mod":5,"value":14,"min":3}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"value":30,"saveDetail":""},"reflex":{"value":28,"saveDetail":""},"will":{"value":25,"saveDetail":""}},"customModifiers":{}},"token":{"disposition":-1,"height":3,"img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/608d82d517318c2169c5dcfb/modules/covalon-expeditions/images/fjordcarver.Token.webp","name":"Facsimile of Fjordcarver","width":3,"displayName":20,"actorLink":false,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":true,"dimSight":500,"brightSight":500,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"color":null},"displayBars":20,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"flags":{"pf2e":{"linkToActorSize":true},"monks-little-details":{"token-highlight":""},"perfect-vision":{"visionRules":"default","monoVisionColor":"","sightLimit":null,"light":{}},"token-auras":{"aura1":{"permission":"all","colour":"#ffffff","opacity":0.5,"distance":null,"square":false},"aura2":{"permission":"all","colour":"#ffffff","opacity":0.5,"distance":null,"square":false}},"core":{}},"randomImg":false,"tint":null,"x":null,"y":null,"elevation":null},"items":[{"_id":"pmqefsGShf77p3Zd","data":{"description":{"value":""},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":["cold","magical","reach-15"],"rarity":"common","custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.769,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-08-14T14:43:15.423-04:00","version":{"schema":0.743,"foundry":"9.269","system":"3.13.5.16"}}},"weaponType":{"value":"melee"},"attack":{"value":""},"damageRolls":{"v4enrkjx1vkly8li9k6n":{"damage":"3d10 + 16","damageType":"piercing"},"eh4ekj7akfeymny3g66q":{"damage":"4d6","damageType":"cold"}},"bonus":{"value":32,"total":27},"attackEffects":{"value":[],"custom":""}},"effects":[],"flags":{},"img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/bazaar/systems/pf2e/assets/icons/default-icons/melee.svg","name":"Jaws","sort":400000,"type":"melee","folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"h6wQ76GXx0XhL0rW","data":{"description":{"value":""},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":["agile","magical","reach-10"],"rarity":"common","custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.769,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-08-14T14:43:15.423-04:00","version":{"schema":0.743,"foundry":"9.269","system":"3.13.5.16"}}},"weaponType":{"value":"melee"},"attack":{"value":""},"damageRolls":{"vhvxp389ejd864a4xzoy":{"damage":"3d10 + 16","damageType":"slashing"}},"bonus":{"value":32,"total":27},"attackEffects":{"value":[],"custom":""}},"effects":[],"flags":{},"img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/bazaar/systems/pf2e/assets/icons/default-icons/melee.svg","name":"Claw","sort":500000,"type":"melee","folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"b4GFgu6HgDqvji6X","data":{"description":{"value":""},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":["magical","reach-20"],"rarity":"common","custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.769,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-08-14T14:43:15.423-04:00","version":{"schema":0.743,"foundry":"9.269","system":"3.13.5.16"}}},"weaponType":{"value":"melee"},"attack":{"value":""},"damageRolls":{"tisdqy7tmlrqju4fwo6r":{"damage":"3d12 + 17","damageType":"bludgeoning"}},"bonus":{"value":30,"total":26},"attackEffects":{"value":[],"custom":""}},"effects":[],"flags":{},"img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/bazaar/systems/pf2e/assets/icons/default-icons/melee.svg","name":"Tail","sort":600000,"type":"melee","folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"y0vt5wkSLNErceZF","data":{"description":{"value":"<p data-visibility=\"gm\"><strong>Trigger</strong> An adjacent creature deals piercing or slashing damage to Fjordcarver.</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> Fjordcarver's blood sprays on the creature, dealing [[/r {4d6}[cold]]]{4d6 cold damage}.

Nearly all other dragons look down on white dragons as hopelessly hotheaded and dull, though this does not make them any less dangerous-in fact, it may mean the opposite. It's nearly impossible to treat with white dragons, not because they lack the capacity to do so, but because they just don't care to. They are as difficult to deal with as they are quick to anger, and they become incensed at almost anything. When a white dragon does speak, it spews threats, inane jokes, and incoherent babbling as a prelude to attacking-and when the attack comes, it's bloody and relentless.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, white dragons prefer very cold, remote locations that are far from people. Dwelling on glacial mountaintops or in ice caverns beneath forbidding tundra, they treat the lands around them as their own personal hunting grounds. They fly out to feed or terrorize other creatures, especially those who trespass near the dragon's territory, then bring any treasure back to be displayed in icy niches in their lairs. They collect all kinds of valuables, with a slight preference for items with high utility-such as tools, trade goods, and fine food-over coins or jewels. The ability to shape ice lets white dragons rearrange their lairs exactly to their specifications, and they take great pride in how they've decorated their homes over the years.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>While there are many types of dragons, from the powerful planar dragons to the strange esoteric dragons, few dragon varieties are as well-known and as rightly feared as the chromatic dragons. Differentiated by the hue of their scales, each color of dragon unleashes its own flavor of murderous cruelty-be it by claw, tooth, or breath-and unlike most creatures, dragons only become more powerful as they age. Their lust for treasure, food, bloodshed, and control are legendary. Physically powerful with egos to match, these dragons are often morally depraved and act as criminal masterminds, vicious tyrants, or voracious raiders.</p>","privateNotes":""},"traits":{"senses":{"value":"darkvision, scent (imprecise) 60 feet, snow vision"},"traits":{"value":["cold","dragon"],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":["common","draconic"],"selected":[],"custom":""},"di":{"value":["cold","fire","paralyzed","sleep"],"custom":""},"dr":[],"dv":[],"rarity":"uncommon","size":{"value":"huge"},"ci":[]},"resources":{"focus":{"max":1,"value":1}},"schema":{"version":0.769,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-08-17T18:26:40.732+01:00","version":{"schema":0.743,"foundry":"9.269","system":"3.13.5.16"}}},"abilities":{"str":{"mod":7,"value":24,"min":3},"dex":{"mod":3,"value":16,"min":3},"con":{"mod":7,"value":24,"min":3},"int":{"mod":3,"value":16,"min":3},"wis":{"mod":3,"value":16,"min":3},"cha":{"mod":3,"value":16,"min":3}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"value":22,"saveDetail":""},"reflex":{"value":19,"saveDetail":""},"will":{"value":16,"saveDetail":""}},"customModifiers":{}},"token":{"disposition":-1,"height":3,"img":"modules/covalon-expeditions/images/fjordcarver.Token.webp","name":"Facsimile of Fjordcarver","width":3,"displayName":20,"actorLink":false,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":true,"dimSight":500,"brightSight":500,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"color":null},"displayBars":20,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"flags":{"pf2e":{"linkToActorSize":true},"monks-little-details":{"token-highlight":""},"perfect-vision":{"visionRules":"default","monoVisionColor":"","sightLimit":null,"light":{}},"token-auras":{"aura1":{"permission":"all","colour":"#ffffff","opacity":0.5,"distance":null,"square":false},"aura2":{"permission":"all","colour":"#ffffff","opacity":0.5,"distance":null,"square":false}},"core":{}},"randomImg":false,"tint":null,"x":null,"y":null,"elevation":null},"items":[{"_id":"pmqefsGShf77p3Zd","data":{"description":{"value":""},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":["cold","magical","reach-15"],"rarity":"common","custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.769,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-08-17T18:26:40.733+01:00","version":{"schema":0.743,"foundry":"9.269","system":"3.13.5.16"}}},"weaponType":{"value":"melee"},"attack":{"value":""},"damageRolls":{"v4enrkjx1vkly8li9k6n":{"damage":"2d10+9","damageType":"piercing"},"eh4ekj7akfeymny3g66q":{"damage":"2d6","damageType":"cold"}},"bonus":{"value":23,"total":23},"attackEffects":{"value":[],"custom":""}},"effects":[],"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/melee.svg","name":"Jaws","sort":400000,"type":"melee","folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"h6wQ76GXx0XhL0rW","data":{"description":{"value":""},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":["agile","magical","reach-10"],"rarity":"common","custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.769,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-08-17T18:26:40.733+01:00","version":{"schema":0.743,"foundry":"9.269","system":"3.13.5.16"}}},"weaponType":{"value":"melee"},"attack":{"value":""},"damageRolls":{"vhvxp389ejd864a4xzoy":{"damage":"2d10+9","damageType":"slashing"}},"bonus":{"value":23,"total":23},"attackEffects":{"value":[],"custom":""}},"effects":[],"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/melee.svg","name":"Claw","sort":500000,"type":"melee","folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"b4GFgu6HgDqvji6X","data":{"description":{"value":""},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":["magical","reach-20"],"rarity":"common","custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.769,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-08-17T18:26:40.733+01:00","version":{"schema":0.743,"foundry":"9.269","system":"3.13.5.16"}}},"weaponType":{"value":"melee"},"attack":{"value":""},"damageRolls":{"tisdqy7tmlrqju4fwo6r":{"damage":"2d12+9","damageType":"bludgeoning"}},"bonus":{"value":21,"total":21},"attackEffects":{"value":[],"custom":""}},"effects":[],"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/melee.svg","name":"Tail","sort":600000,"type":"melee","folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"y0vt5wkSLNErceZF","data":{"description":{"value":"<p data-visibility=\"gm\"><strong>Trigger</strong> An adjacent creature deals piercing or slashing damage to Fjordcarver.</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> Fjordcarver's blood sprays on the creature, dealing [[/r {2d6}[cold]]]{2d6 cold damage}.

Nearly all other dragons look down on white dragons as hopelessly hotheaded and dull, though this does not make them any less dangerous-in fact, it may mean the opposite. It's nearly impossible to treat with white dragons, not because they lack the capacity to do so, but because they just don't care to. They are as difficult to deal with as they are quick to anger, and they become incensed at almost anything. When a white dragon does speak, it spews threats, inane jokes, and incoherent babbling as a prelude to attacking-and when the attack comes, it's bloody and relentless.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, white dragons prefer very cold, remote locations that are far from people. Dwelling on glacial mountaintops or in ice caverns beneath forbidding tundra, they treat the lands around them as their own personal hunting grounds. They fly out to feed or terrorize other creatures, especially those who trespass near the dragon's territory, then bring any treasure back to be displayed in icy niches in their lairs. They collect all kinds of valuables, with a slight preference for items with high utility-such as tools, trade goods, and fine food-over coins or jewels. The ability to shape ice lets white dragons rearrange their lairs exactly to their specifications, and they take great pride in how they've decorated their homes over the years.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>While there are many types of dragons, from the powerful planar dragons to the strange esoteric dragons, few dragon varieties are as well-known and as rightly feared as the chromatic dragons. Differentiated by the hue of their scales, each color of dragon unleashes its own flavor of murderous cruelty-be it by claw, tooth, or breath-and unlike most creatures, dragons only become more powerful as they age. Their lust for treasure, food, bloodshed, and control are legendary. Physically powerful with egos to match, these dragons are often morally depraved and act as criminal masterminds, vicious tyrants, or voracious raiders.</p>","privateNotes":""},"traits":{"senses":{"value":"darkvision, scent (imprecise) 60 feet, snow vision"},"traits":{"value":["cold","dragon"],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":["common","draconic"],"selected":[],"custom":""},"di":{"value":["cold","fire","paralyzed","sleep"],"custom":""},"dr":[],"dv":[],"rarity":"uncommon","size":{"value":"huge"},"ci":[]},"resources":{"focus":{"max":1,"value":1}},"schema":{"version":0.769,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-08-17T18:26:40.752+01:00","version":{"schema":0.743,"foundry":"9.269","system":"3.13.5.16"}}},"abilities":{"str":{"mod":6,"value":22,"min":3},"dex":{"mod":2,"value":14,"min":3},"con":{"mod":6,"value":22,"min":3},"int":{"mod":2,"value":14,"min":3},"wis":{"mod":2,"value":14,"min":3},"cha":{"mod":2,"value":14,"min":3}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"value":18,"saveDetail":""},"reflex":{"value":15,"saveDetail":""},"will":{"value":12,"saveDetail":""}},"customModifiers":{}},"token":{"disposition":-1,"height":3,"img":"modules/covalon-expeditions/images/fjordcarver.Token.webp","name":"Facsimile of Fjordcarver","width":3,"displayName":20,"actorLink":false,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":true,"dimSight":500,"brightSight":500,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"color":null},"displayBars":20,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"flags":{"pf2e":{"linkToActorSize":true},"monks-little-details":{"token-highlight":""},"perfect-vision":{"visionRules":"default","monoVisionColor":"","sightLimit":null,"light":{}},"token-auras":{"aura1":{"permission":"all","colour":"#ffffff","opacity":0.5,"distance":null,"square":false},"aura2":{"permission":"all","colour":"#ffffff","opacity":0.5,"distance":null,"square":false}},"core":{}},"randomImg":false,"tint":null,"x":null,"y":null,"elevation":null},"items":[{"_id":"pmqefsGShf77p3Zd","data":{"description":{"value":""},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":["cold","magical","reach-15"],"rarity":"common","custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.769,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-08-17T18:26:40.752+01:00","version":{"schema":0.743,"foundry":"9.269","system":"3.13.5.16"}}},"weaponType":{"value":"melee"},"attack":{"value":""},"damageRolls":{"v4enrkjx1vkly8li9k6n":{"damage":"2d8+6","damageType":"piercing"},"eh4ekj7akfeymny3g66q":{"damage":"1d6","damageType":"cold"}},"bonus":{"value":18,"total":19},"attackEffects":{"value":[],"custom":""}},"effects":[],"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/melee.svg","name":"Jaws","sort":400000,"type":"melee","folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"h6wQ76GXx0XhL0rW","data":{"description":{"value":""},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":["agile","magical","reach-10"],"rarity":"common","custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.769,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-08-17T18:26:40.752+01:00","version":{"schema":0.743,"foundry":"9.269","system":"3.13.5.16"}}},"weaponType":{"value":"melee"},"attack":{"value":""},"damageRolls":{"vhvxp389ejd864a4xzoy":{"damage":"2d8+6","damageType":"slashing"}},"bonus":{"value":18,"total":19},"attackEffects":{"value":[],"custom":""}},"effects":[],"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/melee.svg","name":"Claw","sort":500000,"type":"melee","folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"b4GFgu6HgDqvji6X","data":{"description":{"value":""},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":["magical","reach-20"],"rarity":"common","custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.769,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-08-17T18:26:40.752+01:00","version":{"schema":0.743,"foundry":"9.269","system":"3.13.5.16"}}},"weaponType":{"value":"melee"},"attack":{"value":""},"damageRolls":{"tisdqy7tmlrqju4fwo6r":{"damage":"2d10+5","damageType":"bludgeoning"}},"bonus":{"value":16,"total":17},"attackEffects":{"value":[],"custom":""}},"effects":[],"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/melee.svg","name":"Tail","sort":600000,"type":"melee","folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"y0vt5wkSLNErceZF","data":{"description":{"value":"<p data-visibility=\"gm\"><strong>Trigger</strong> An adjacent creature deals piercing or slashing damage to Fjordcarver.</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> Fjordcarver's blood sprays on the creature, dealing [[/r {1d6}[cold]]]{1d6 cold damage}.

Nearly all other dragons look down on white dragons as hopelessly hotheaded and dull, though this does not make them any less dangerous-in fact, it may mean the opposite. It's nearly impossible to treat with white dragons, not because they lack the capacity to do so, but because they just don't care to. They are as difficult to deal with as they are quick to anger, and they become incensed at almost anything. When a white dragon does speak, it spews threats, inane jokes, and incoherent babbling as a prelude to attacking-and when the attack comes, it's bloody and relentless.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, white dragons prefer very cold, remote locations that are far from people. Dwelling on glacial mountaintops or in ice caverns beneath forbidding tundra, they treat the lands around them as their own personal hunting grounds. They fly out to feed or terrorize other creatures, especially those who trespass near the dragon's territory, then bring any treasure back to be displayed in icy niches in their lairs. They collect all kinds of valuables, with a slight preference for items with high utility-such as tools, trade goods, and fine food-over coins or jewels. The ability to shape ice lets white dragons rearrange their lairs exactly to their specifications, and they take great pride in how they've decorated their homes over the years.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>While there are many types of dragons, from the powerful planar dragons to the strange esoteric dragons, few dragon varieties are as well-known and as rightly feared as the chromatic dragons. Differentiated by the hue of their scales, each color of dragon unleashes its own flavor of murderous cruelty-be it by claw, tooth, or breath-and unlike most creatures, dragons only become more powerful as they age. Their lust for treasure, food, bloodshed, and control are legendary. Physically powerful with egos to match, these dragons are often morally depraved and act as criminal masterminds, vicious tyrants, or voracious raiders.</p>","privateNotes":""},"traits":{"senses":{"value":"darkvision, scent (imprecise) 60 feet, snow vision"},"traits":{"value":["cold","dragon"],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":["common","draconic"],"selected":[],"custom":""},"di":{"value":["cold","fire","paralyzed","sleep"],"custom":""},"dr":[],"dv":[],"rarity":"uncommon","size":{"value":"huge"},"ci":[]},"resources":{"focus":{"max":1,"value":1}},"schema":{"version":0.769,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-08-17T18:26:40.758+01:00","version":{"schema":0.743,"foundry":"9.269","system":"3.13.5.16"}}},"abilities":{"str":{"mod":8,"value":26,"min":3},"dex":{"mod":4,"value":16,"min":3},"con":{"mod":8,"value":20,"min":3},"int":{"mod":4,"value":14,"min":3},"wis":{"mod":4,"value":16,"min":3},"cha":{"mod":4,"value":14,"min":3}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"value":26,"saveDetail":""},"reflex":{"value":23,"saveDetail":""},"will":{"value":20,"saveDetail":""}},"customModifiers":{}},"token":{"disposition":-1,"height":3,"img":"modules/covalon-expeditions/images/fjordcarver.Token.webp","name":"Facsimile of Fjordcarver","width":3,"displayName":20,"actorLink":false,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":true,"dimSight":500,"brightSight":500,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"color":null},"displayBars":20,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"flags":{"pf2e":{"linkToActorSize":true},"monks-little-details":{"token-highlight":""},"perfect-vision":{"visionRules":"default","monoVisionColor":"","sightLimit":null,"light":{}},"token-auras":{"aura1":{"permission":"all","colour":"#ffffff","opacity":0.5,"distance":null,"square":false},"aura2":{"permission":"all","colour":"#ffffff","opacity":0.5,"distance":null,"square":false}},"core":{}},"randomImg":false,"tint":null,"x":null,"y":null,"elevation":null},"items":[{"_id":"pmqefsGShf77p3Zd","data":{"description":{"value":""},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":["cold","magical","reach-15"],"rarity":"common","custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.769,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-08-17T18:26:40.758+01:00","version":{"schema":0.743,"foundry":"9.269","system":"3.13.5.16"}}},"weaponType":{"value":"melee"},"attack":{"value":""},"damageRolls":{"v4enrkjx1vkly8li9k6n":{"damage":"3d10+12","damageType":"piercing"},"eh4ekj7akfeymny3g66q":{"damage":"3d6","damageType":"cold"}},"bonus":{"value":27,"total":27},"attackEffects":{"value":[],"custom":""}},"effects":[],"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/melee.svg","name":"Jaws","sort":400000,"type":"melee","folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"h6wQ76GXx0XhL0rW","data":{"description":{"value":""},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":["agile","magical","reach-10"],"rarity":"common","custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.769,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-08-17T18:26:40.758+01:00","version":{"schema":0.743,"foundry":"9.269","system":"3.13.5.16"}}},"weaponType":{"value":"melee"},"attack":{"value":""},"damageRolls":{"vhvxp389ejd864a4xzoy":{"damage":"3d10+12","damageType":"slashing"}},"bonus":{"value":27,"total":27},"attackEffects":{"value":[],"custom":""}},"effects":[],"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/melee.svg","name":"Claw","sort":500000,"type":"melee","folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"b4GFgu6HgDqvji6X","data":{"description":{"value":""},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":["magical","reach-20"],"rarity":"common","custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.769,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-08-17T18:26:40.758+01:00","version":{"schema":0.743,"foundry":"9.269","system":"3.13.5.16"}}},"weaponType":{"value":"melee"},"attack":{"value":""},"damageRolls":{"tisdqy7tmlrqju4fwo6r":{"damage":"3d12+12","damageType":"bludgeoning"}},"bonus":{"value":25,"total":26},"attackEffects":{"value":[],"custom":""}},"effects":[],"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/melee.svg","name":"Tail","sort":600000,"type":"melee","folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"y0vt5wkSLNErceZF","data":{"description":{"value":"<p data-visibility=\"gm\"><strong>Trigger</strong> An adjacent creature deals piercing or slashing damage to Fjordcarver.</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> Fjordcarver's blood sprays on the creature, dealing [[/r {3d6}[cold]]]{3d6 cold damage}.
