{"name":"Ratchethallow Expedition","pages":[{"sort":100000,"name":"Ratchethallow Briefing","type":"text","_id":"6lj7JCJxSXPY6tdp","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<h2>Background</h2><p>The greatest mechanical minds of Ratchethallow came together in rare cooperation after the start of the Cataclysm to create the Cataclysm Defence Machine, a mysterious contraption intended to keep the city safe from the wild and far-reaching effects of the Cataclysm. Included in this, is a wide mechanical barrier around the city. </p><p>Once the birthplace of progress, Ratchethallow has remained silent and mysteriously obscured by the mechanical barrier since the fateful day of its Cataclysm Defence Machine being activated. Plumes of smoke still billow from vents in the dome, however, and this can only be a sign of valuable resources inside. Hopefully the denizens of Ratchethallow remain, and can assist us in the fight against the Maw! </p><h2>Mission Overview</h2><p>After a bumpy journey across the land towards Ratchethallow's location, Covalon citizens noticed a number of mechanically augmented beasts and creatures in the vicinity of the City of Gears. They have been far too skittish for us to get close enough to study, but their very existence is deeply worrying. What mad mind had completed such experiments and 'augmentations'? For what purpose? </p><p>It is clear that we need to study these creatures. Further, we have been able to penetrate the barrier surrounding the city sufficiently to allow for small groups to infiltrate the dome and determine what is creating the smoke inside. We have also spotted some heavily guarded areas outside of the dome that look to be small industrial expansions. We need to know what these are, what their purpose is and also if they hold any insight into what has happened to Ratchethallow!</p><h2>How to Run an Expedition</h2><p>Expeditions are composed of two subtypes: missions and finales. Missions are a set of three dungeon-like adventures that are narratively linked, but can be completed in any order. Each mission must include predetermined narrative and mechanical elements while sticking to a theme of locations, creatures, and loot, which are included in its associated journal entry, with the specifics of the blanks to be filled in by the GM of the adventure. Like other adventure types, Dungeon Guides must submit their expedition missions for approval.</p><p>When reading the instructions for an expedition, you may see key terms surrounded by number signs. These indicate that the term should be replaced by a value that's dependent on the adventure's average party level. When submitting your expedition for approval, you must include the values you plan to replace these terms with. Here is a list of terms:</p><ul><li><strong>#Creature [Table Number] [Modifier]#</strong> should be replaced by a value according to a table in the <a href=\"https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=995\">Building Creatures</a> section of the Gamemastery Guide. For example, \"#Creature 2-8 Minimum# means that you should reference the Building Creatures rules, look for Table 2-8, and use the value in the Minimum column for the creature's level (adjusted for elite or weak as appropriate).</li><li><strong>#Hazard [Table Number] [Modifier]# </strong>should be replaced by a value according to a table in the <a href=\"https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=1043\">Building Hazards</a> section of the Gamemastery Guide. For example, \"#Hazard 2-16 Simple Damage# means that you should reference the Building Hazards rules, look for table 2-16, and use the value in the Simple Damage column for the hazard's level.</li><li><strong>#DC [Modifier]# </strong>should be replaced by a value according to the <a href=\"https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=554\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DCs by Level</a> table in the Core Rulebook. If a modifier is included, the value should be adjusted accordingly. For example, \"#DC +5#\" means that you should reference the DCs by Level table, find the value appropriate for the party's average level, then add 5 to it.</li></ul><p>Finales are singular encounters against a narratively significant threat that conclude an expedition. They come in two versions: normal mode and hard mode. Before a finale is cleared for the first time, it can only be run by Covalon administrators and moderators, and is ran at hard mode. Afterwards, the finale can be ran by any Dungeon Guide at normal mode (though players can request hard mode if they'd like). Normal mode can be run in Tier 2 or above, and hard mode can only be run at the highest tier, intended for max level characters. Unlike missions, finales use a specific map and specific creatures, included with this module.</p><p>Each finale comes with three variant modifications. When running a normal mode finale, a GM choose one of the three modifications to use, or can roll [[/r 1d3]] to randomly determine which modification to use. When running a hard mode finale, the GM uses all three modifications. There are no additional rewards for completing hard mode.</p><h2>Reporting a Completed Expedition</h2><p>When reporting a completed expedition in the Dungeon Summaries channel, use the <strong>exact name</strong> of the adventure as the adventure's title. For example, if you ran the first mission of Ratchethallow, the summary's title should be \"<span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Ratchethallow Mission A: Machine Hunter</span>\" exactly. The summary should otherwise follow the same format as dungeons.</p><p>Finally, any narrative-based knowledge or intrigue that the players gain as a result of the expedition should be left out of the summary. For example, if the players complete a bonus objective that allows them to learn special information as detailed in the Required Elements or Recommended Loot section of each journal entry, that should be left out of the dungeon summary.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":200000,"name":"Ratchethallow Mission A: Machine Hunter","type":"text","_id":"RFBRnaGh7oPaRlT2","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<h3>Hook</h3><p>A Mechanical Monster has discovered our base camp and is making its way back into Ratchethallow. We need you to chase the creature and intercept it before it can make it back to one of the access points into the city's barrier. If you fail to do so, we will need to strengthen our defenses to keep any assaults on the camp at bay.</p><h3>Required Elements</h3><ol><li><p>All creatures in this Mission must have the <strong>Construct</strong> Trait added to them if they do not already have it, they do not need to have the Mindless Trait though.</p></li><li><p>The Final Encounter should be a Moderate Encounter and consist of a Large (or larger) construct that the Players have been pursuing, and at least one lackey of equal strength or weaker.</p></li><li><p>As the Players track the Machine across the outskirts of Ratchethallow they will be asked to make several skill checks at various points in the Mission. This Hunt uses the Victory Point Sub-system. Taking an action within the Victory Point system constitutes a 10 minute exploration activity. <strong>NOTE: For all Tiers except Tier 5, this required element accounts for a total of 30 XP from the Mission's total Encounter Budget. In Tier 5 this does not count towards the total XP budget.</strong></p><hr /><ul><li><p>The Victory Point Sub-system allows for the accrual of \"Victory Points\" for accomplishing a series of tasks. In the case of The Hunt, there will be 3 opportunities to earn victory points (simply let your Players know that they will need to make skill checks at various points but all of the Skill Checks will be Secret). <em>Keep a tally of the successes and failures as they will effect the starting state of the final encounter.</em></p><ul><li><p>Successes and failures in the listed areas below have the following affect:</p><ul><li><p>Critical Success: The Player earns 2 Victory Points.</p></li><li><p>Success: The Player earns 1 Victory Point.</p></li><li><p>Failure: The Player earns no Victory Points.</p></li><li><p>Critical Failure: The Player loses 1 Victory Point.</p></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><hr /><ol><li><p>Find the Trail: The Players must find the trail of the Machine. All Players may attempt a Nature or Survival check to find the Tracks, or a Diplomacy or Society check to ask the scouts if they saw which way the machine went. These checks have a DC of <strong>#DC +0#</strong>. These checks take place prior to the first encounter.</p></li><li><p>The Hunters Become the Hunted: After the First Encounter the Players notice a large group of machines that are hunting them (the Players should be able to infer that the machines appear to be searching for something, but not what specifically). All Players may make attempt Stealth or Survival Check to hide their own tracks or avoid being spotted by the machines, or any of the Skills associated with the Magical Traditions (Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion) to active a nearby piece of machinery that requires a magical input to create a diversion (If the players ask how they would know this, it can be said that they have seen similar machines around the base camp that some of the Seekers of Secrets and Crafter's Union have been trying to figure out how to use). These Checks have a DC of <strong>#DC +2#.</strong></p><section id=\"secret-2shZbNm7BbSDgFWN\" class=\"secret\"><p>Feel free to have some of these creatures make up the second encounter if you think it appropriate.</p></section></li><li><p>A Possible Shortcut: After the Second Encounter the Players see the Machine in the distance and it appears closer than they thought, the only problem is there is a barricade in their path (such collapsed building, or a bridge needs to be lowered across a chasm). All Players may attempt an Athletics or Acrobatics check to move or jump over the barrier or a Crafting Check to find a way to move the obstacle. These checks have a DC of <strong>#DC +2#.</strong></p></li></ol></li></ol><hr /><p>When the Players make it to the final encounter, add up all of the Victory Points that they have earned and apply the corresponding starting condition to the final encounter.</p><ul><li><p>0 - 2 Points: The Players took too long and the Construct got back to safety inside Ratchethallow's magical barrier. There is no final encounter.</p></li><li><p>3 - 8 Points: The Construct has been watching the Players approach it and has made preparations to defeat them. It has equipped and armed a large grappling hook to grab the closest player to it and pull it towards itself. At the start of the round, it makes an attack against the player <strong>#Creature 2.9 High#</strong> dealing bludgeoning damage <strong>#Creature 2.10 Low#</strong> and pulls the Player 30 feet towards the Construct. It can only use this ability once.</p></li><li><p>9 - 12 Points: The Players arrive just barely before the Construct and notice a Grappling Hook Cannon nearby, they have time to set it up but the Construct notices them doing so. Combat begins as normal but the Players can use the grappling hook against the Construct to pull it towards them. The stats for the Grappling hook are the same as noted above.</p></li><li><p>13+ Points: The Players arrive at ahead of the Construct's path and can set up an ambush using a grappling hook that they discovered at the location. The Grappling Hook has the same stats as above. The Construct and its minion(s) begin combat flat-footed and the Players are undetected until a Player completes an action. The Construct's party spend all their actions moving until a Player moves, attacks, or completes any action that would reveal their location.</p></li></ul><p>Regardless of the number of successes or failures at each opportunity to earn victory points the party can only spend one 10-minute exploration each time to make these checks, any subsequent attempts only add to the amount of time it takes to catch the machine. If the Party takes more than 1 10-minute period to rest, remove 1 victory point from their total for each subsequent 10-minute period after the first.</p><h3>Recommended Locations</h3><p>Locations such as Abandoned Warehouses, Arid Scrubland, Deserts, or even destroyed city streets will work for this encounter.</p><h3>Recommended Creatures</h3><p>Animals, Beasts, Constructs, Giants, and Humanoids. Just make sure to add the Construct Trait to any non-construct creature as there is no organic life in Ratchethallow.</p><p>Feel free to remove the mindless Trait if you would like as these constructs often have a level of sentience, although not often much more than to make optimal decisions to perform basic functions and tasks.</p><h3>Recommended Loot</h3><p>The entirety of the treasure budget should given out in raw Gold. Depending on how well the Players did in stopping the Construct award the Gold as follows:</p><ul><li><p>75% - The Players failed to stop the Construct from getting back inside Ratchethallow.</p></li><li><p>100% - The Players defeated the Construct but did not manage to get more than 12 Victory Points</p></li><li><p>110% - The Players got 13 or more Victory Points and one of them found some valuable machinery when they were setting up the ambush.</p></li></ul>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":300000,"name":"Ratchethallow Mission B: Factory Infiltration","type":"text","_id":"E98GCvRg3KqoQbGn","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<h3>Hook</h3><p>A way into Ratchethallow was discovered through one of the perimeter factories.
