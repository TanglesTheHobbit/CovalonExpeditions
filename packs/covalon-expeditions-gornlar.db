{"_id":"4RSt9ODgPk4YfMiU","name":"Gornlar Briefing","content":"<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>Gornlar was a nation composed of an unlikely alliance between several warlords cemented by a shared value: ambition. Not content with their simple lives as hunters and mercenaries, the peoples of these rocky hills banded together to create a legacy of strength and prestige for their descendents. At first, these new warlords fought between each other, but in the negotiations that followed, they realized that their combined power could create something greater.</p>\n<p>Their military might was unmatched on the western continent of Elleaterra. Gornlar's territory quickly expanded to cover the entire north side of their continent, kept in check only by the Ikougan navy and privateers. Their ambitions turned from that of expansion to conquest, and they were preparing to sail north in search of wealth to pillage, but were interrupted by a conquesting force from Verndhelt arriving suddenly on their shores. The Gornlarians fought valiantly, driving back Iron Empire, but not without significant casualties. Gornlar's ambitions changed once again: instead of leaving their lands to conquer others, they would build upon what their ancestors had already achieved.</p>\n<p>For generations, Gornlar remained peaceful. New freeholds were founded throughout the countryside and roads were built to connect them. Their society was insular to outsiders, receiving only the occasional merchant from Ikouga or Primrose, until ten years before the Cataclysm, when refugees from Taltain began to swarm Gornlar's shores en masse. The Taltainian refugees begged for the warriors of Gornlar to overthrow the island's ruling caste and liberate the common folk. The blood of their ancestral warlords boiled within them, and with little delay, Gornlar sent her armies to liberate Taltain.</p>\n<p>The liberation effort was successful, and Taltain joined the nation of Gornlar as a vassal state. Many of Gornlar's warriors chose to stay in the wealthy island nation of Taltain instead of returning home, leading to the freeholds being vastly underdefended when the Cataclysm struck and dragons razed Gornlar to the ground.</p>\n<p>For more information on Gornlar, see its entry in the <a href=\"https://scribe.pf2.tools/v/8vMfPSF7-covalon-player-s-guide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Covalon Player's Guide</a>.</p>\n<h2>Mission Overview</h2>\n<p>As the clockwork drill pierced through the final stretch of the mountains separating Covalon from Gornlar, a terrifying white dragon descended upon the vehicle. Kicking itself into overdrive, the drill sped for cover as fast as it could, narrowly avoiding the dragon's icy breath. It skidded on frozen ground, losing traction and slamming into a large rock, flipping it over. The rock then rose up high, revealing itself to be an ancient and furious magma dragon, which was the true subject of the white dragon's ire. The magma dragon shoved the drill aside, flipping it back onto its treads, then charged at the white dragon. The terrain shifted between ice and magma as the two dragons collided, and the drill - battered, bruised, and running low on operational time - bored into the side of a nearby cliff in a desperate attempt to find shelter from the battle. Pinned down in their cavernous refuge beneath a mountain that is half-volcanic and half-frozen, the Covalonians have decided to erect their base camp here, as further exploration is too dangerous as long as those two dragons roam the lands.</p>\n<h2>How to Run an Expedition</h2>\n<p>Expeditions are composed of two subtypes: missions and finales. Missions are a set of three dungeon-like adventures that are narratively linked, but can be completed in any order. Each mission must include predetermined narrative and mechanical elements while sticking to a theme of locations, creatures, and loot, which are included in its associated journal entry, with the specifics of the blanks to be filled in by the GM of the adventure. Like other adventure types, Dungeon Guides must submit their expedition missions for approval.</p>\n<p>When reading the instructions for an expedition, you may see key terms surrounded by number signs. These indicate that the term should be replaced by a value that's dependent on the adventure's average party level.  If you have any questions about how to apply these terms or any of the required elements, be sure to ask about them during your submission for approval. Here is a list of terms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>#Creature [Table Number] [Modifier]#</strong> should be replaced by a value according to a table in the <a href=\"https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=995\">Building Creatures</a> section of the Gamemastery Guide. For example, \"#Creature 2-8 Minimum# means that you should reference the Building Creatures rules, look for Table 2-8, and use the value in the Minimum column for the creature's level (adjusted for elite or weak as appropriate).</li>\n<li><strong>#Hazard [Table Number] [Modifier]# </strong>should be replaced by a value according to a table in the <a href=\"https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=1043\">Building Hazards</a> section of the Gamemastery Guide. For example, \"#Hazard 2-16 Simple Damage# means that you should reference the Building Hazards rules, look for table 2-16, and use the value in the Simple Damage column for the hazard's level.</li>\n<li><strong>#DC [Modifier]# </strong>should be replaced by a value according to the <a href=\"https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=554\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DCs by Level</a> table in the Core Rulebook. If a modifier is included, the value should be adjusted accordingly. For example, \"#DC +5#\" means that you should reference the DCs by Level table, find the value appropriate for the party's average level, then add 5 to it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Finales are singular encounters against a narratively significant threat that conclude an expedition. They come in two versions: normal mode and hard mode. Before a finale is cleared for the first time, it can only be run by Covalon administrators and moderators, and is ran at hard mode. Afterwards, the finale can be ran by any Dungeon Guide at normal mode (though players can request hard mode if they'd like). Normal mode can be run in Tier 2 or above, and hard mode can only be run at the highest tier, intended for max level characters. Unlike missions, finales use a specific map and specific creatures, included with this module.</p>\n<p>Each finale comes with three variant modifications. When running a normal mode finale, a GM choose one of the three modifications to use, or can roll [[/r 1d3]] to randomly determine which modification to use. When running a hard mode finale, the GM uses all three modifications. There are no additional rewards for completing hard mode.</p>\n<h2>Reporting a Completed Expedition</h2>\n<p>When reporting a completed expedition in the Dungeon Summaries channel, use the <strong>exact name</strong> of the adventure as the adventure's title. For example, if you ran the first mission of Ikouga, the summary's title should be \"Ikouga Mission A: Retame the Island\" exactly. The summary should otherwise follow the same format as dungeons.</p>\n<p>Finally, any narrative-based knowledge or intrigue that the players gain as a result of the expedition should be left out of the summary. For example, if the players complete a bonus objective that allows them to learn special information as detailed in the Required Elements or Recommended Loot section of each journal entry, that should be left out of the dungeon summary.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"7RtLbrlfn9D7fL4K":3},"flags":{}}
{"_id":"Pkit9W2Ook6HqwEG","name":"Gornlar Finale","content":"<h2>Gornlar Finale: Ashgut and Fjordcarver</h2>\n<h3>Hook</h3>\n<p>In the mountains south of Gornlar, the Covalon adventurers discovered that a pair of legendary dragons had been roused from hibernation by the Cataclysm, partaking in the power of the Maw in order to cause untold destruction to the surrounding lands. Though Ashgut and Fjordcarver were defeated and a Vessel was destroyed, the Maw refuses to take this loss lying down. Another pair of dragons has been spotted heading for the transplanted Seed of Terra sapling - and they look eerily similar to dragons that were recently felled.</p>\n<h3>Battle in the Dichotomous Valley</h3>\n<p>In an attempt to regain lost ground, the Maw has created facsimiles of both Ashgut and Fjordcarver and has sent them barreling towards the transplanted Seed of Terra. Covalon's tacticians have determined that the valley half-covered in frost and half-covered in flame will serve as the best place to intercept them, and once again, both dragons will need to be fought at the same time in order to use their conflicting energies against them.</p>\n<p>The PCs begin in the middle of the map, with Ashgut starting at the west end of the valley and Fjordcarver starting at the east end. Generally speaking, Ashgut and Fjordcarver prefer to utilize their long range rather than move, but they can move if they need to maneuver around conjured objects, effects, or anything that would significantly hinder them. Although Ashgut can climb up the sides of the valley and Fjordcarver can fly high into the air, they generally should not do this as it would create a negative play experience for the players, especially since this encounter is designed to take place on the ground.</p>\n<p>If the GM has not done so yet, they should select one of the three Modifications to apply (found in both Ashgut and Fjordcarver's statblocks), or roll [[/r 1d3]] to determine one randomly. Do not tell the players which Modification is in effect. (For Hard Mode, use all 3 modifications.) Note: The same modification must be chosen for both Ashgut and Fjordcarver; they cannot have different modifications.</p>\n<p>Though not shown on the map, if the PCs need to escape from the encounter, they can do so by running through a tunnel in the southern wall at the middle of the map. This tunnel should not be used for fighting though, as the dragons' special abilities will make quick work of any party foolish enough to entrench themselves there.</p>\n<h3>Tactics Overview</h3>\n<p>Ashgut and Fjordcarver are both immensely powerful on their own, but their signature abilities conflict with each other, giving the PCs an advantage by battling both of the dragons simultaneously. The main gimmick of the encounter is <strong>Flash Freeze </strong>and <strong>Landwaster</strong>. At the end of her first turn, Ashgut will begin charging Landwaster, firing it off at the beginning of her next turn and dealing immense damage to anyone in contact with the ground or a wall in the arena. But before Ashgut can finish using Landwaster, Fjordcarver will use Flash Freeze, which \"accidentally\" creates icicles that reduce the damage dealt by Landwaster as long as a PC is adjacent to one when Landwaster's damage occurs. (Fjordcarver's <strong>Jealousy</strong> ability ensures that he always moves after Ashgut, regardless of initiative results or delays.) The icicles are then destroyed, which prevents the arena from being flooded with obstacles. Without Flash Freeze, Ashgut's Landwaster would deal incredible amounts of damage that would quickly overwhelm the players, while without Landwaster, Fjordcarver's Flash Freeze would eventually fill the entire arena with icicles, preventing players from dodging them and forcing them to be impaled.</p>\n<p>Players may consider using flight to avoid these powerful attacks, but Ashgut's <strong>Sulfuric Skies </strong>and Fjordcarver's <strong>Localized Blizzard </strong>make flight a risky prospect. These abilities impose powerful penalties and adverse conditions on flying players, but have no effect against players on the ground or players who are climbing (though climbing does not make a player safe from Flash Freeze or Landwaster).</p>\n<p>Ahsgut and Fjordcarver's presences are so strong that they affect the very terrain around them. <strong>Molten Fields </strong>and <strong>Frozen Fields </strong>impose elemental weaknesses on the PCs that allow the dragons to deal more damage, and during the <strong>Modification - Ley Line Intersection </strong>modification, players may need to swap back and forth between the two fields in order to manage their weakness stacks. If <strong>Modification - Clinging Energy </strong>is in play, the PCs may also need to routinely swap sides so they can clear their persistent damage and avoid taking bonus damage from their elemental weakness.</p>\n<p>Due to the interaction of Flash Freeze and Landwaster, players are incentivized to try to kill both dragons at the same time. This should generally be the most effective strategy, but <strong>Modification - Rapturous Rivalry </strong>can throw a wrench in this by giving one of the dragons a significant heal when their rival dies. </p>\n<p>Ashgut and Fjordcarver should be content to remain at their opposite ends of the arena, using their ranged <strong>Spit Magma </strong>and <strong>Spit Ice </strong>strikes<strong>, Breath Weapon</strong>, and <strong>Burning Stare </strong>or <strong>Frosty Gaze </strong>to hit PCs that aren't in range of their melee strikes. Though GMs may be tempted to use the Breath Weapons each round, it has lower damage than a normal dragon's Breath Weapon, and it may not put as much pressure on the players as focusing on downing a single PC would.</p>\n<h3>Loot</h3>\n<p>The entirety of the treasure budget is given out in raw GP, paid by the NPC used for the hook.

Historians are doing their best to look for records of legendary dragons that might fit the creature's description, but aren't having any luck finding definitive information. Adventurers are tasked with exploring a nearby fiery mountain - likely the home of the magma dragon - to see if they can find any clues, as well as any resources that could help the outpost withstand the cold from the opposite dragon. This is a reconnaissance mission - if the adventurers encounter the magma dragon, they are advised to run away instead of engaging.</p>\n<h3>Required Elements</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>The temperature condition for this mission is extreme heat, dealing <strong>#Hazard 2-16 Complex Damage#</strong> to the PCs every 10 minutes. If a PC has an ability that allows them to extreme heat as severe heat, they only take that damage every hour instead.</li>\n<li>The final encounter should be a chase sequence, budgeted as 120 XP. The players will unknowingly approach Ashgut's nest, and find a sizeable stone on an ornate dias that glows red and gleams when light hits it - a successful <strong>#DC -2# </strong>Arcana or Nature check to Recall Knowledge reveals that this is a magma dragon egg, equally as dangerous as it is valuable, radiating a constant heat that could help in counter the cold from the white dragon (though the examination also reveals that the egg is non-viable). If the players decide to take it, Ashgut erupts into the area shortly after, beginning the chase sequence. See the Chase Sequence section for more details.</li>\n<li style=\"padding-left:var(--space-s)\">At any point before the chase sequence, there should be an illusory wall somewhere in the adventure which can be disbelieved by a character that interacts with it and succeeds at a <strong>#DC +2# </strong>Will save (a character taking the Search exploration activity is considered to be interacting with it). Beyond the illusory wall lies a chamber covered by a 4th-level <em style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em)\">darkness</em> spell. If the PCs enter the chamber, they are hailed by an old man who introduces himself as a displaced Caligni (N male caligni wizard). The caligni's attitude towards the PCs starts off as neutral, be he welcomes them into his home and offers them water, encouraging them to rest and take a break from the heat in his cool-temperature home, which pauses and resets the temperature damage interval (the PCs likely won't have greater darkvision, but can feel around for furniture to sit on). The Caligni is hesitant to talk about certain topics, but the PCs can obtain information about the magma dragon from him if they make a successful <strong style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em)\">#DC +2# </strong>Diplomacy check to Request or Intimidation check to Coerce. (Players can also make <strong style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em)\">#DC</strong><strong style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em)\">#</strong> Diplomacy checks to Make an Impression on him and improve his attitude towards them, which adjusts the Request/Coerce DCs as normal.) On a success, the Caligni tells them that the magma dragon is a legendary creature who has lived for hundreds of years and goes by the name of Ashgut. In the past, she had a violent rivalry with a white dragon that ended up with the two of them being too wounded to continue fighting, and has since been living quietly in the volcano - until recently when she suddenly became violent and active again, scattering the Caligni's tribe to different corners of the mountain. On a critical success, he remembers that the injury Ashgut sustained was to her wings, and she can no longer fly as a result. If the players use a light spell to counteract the 4th-level <em style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em)\">darkness</em> inside the Caligni's home, or if they use <em style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em)\">dispel magic</em> or some other type of ability to remove the darkness, the Caligni's attitude immediately turns hostile, and he demands the players leave him immediately. If he is attacked, he will defend himself, using the stats for a @Compendium[pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary-3.zdJgaVe6VRSfEE1n]{Caligni Caller}.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Chase Sequence</h3>\n<p>When the chase sequence begins, all players roll Perception for initiative - this determines how quickly they react to the event and the order in which they'll be attempting to escape from Ashgut, who is placed at the end of initiative. On each of Ashgut's turns, she rains down molten fury on the players with her powerful breath weapon, dealing <strong>#Hazard 2-16 Complex Damage#</strong> damage with a <strong>#Hazard 2-16 HDC# </strong>basic Reflex save. Half the damage is fire, and half is bludgeoning.</p>\n<p>The players must overcome a series of Obstacles in order to escape from Ashgut. On their turn, a player can attempt a check to Overcome the current Obstacle and earn Chase Points for their party.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Success </strong>The party gains 2 Chase Points.<br /><strong>Success</strong> The party gains 1 Chase Point.<br /><strong>Critical Failure </strong>The party loses 1 Chase Point.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, instead of making a check to Overcome the Obstacle, a player can gain three actions as normal that they can use to support their fellow party members. A player might even have a spell or ability that allows them to succeed at Overcoming the Obstacle without even needing to make a check, at the GM's discretion. Players cannot Delay during the chase, nor can they attack Ashgut; the heat of her flames are much too intense to allow anyone to get close, even with protective magic.</p>\n<p>Once enough Chase Points have been achieved to clear an Obstacle, the entire party moves onto the next Obstacle. Chase Points do not carry over between Obstacles. Use <strong>#DC# </strong>for the DC of all checks to overcome obstacles. Each Obstacle requires a number of Chase Points to clear based on the size of the party; if there are less than 6 players in the party, reduce the amount of required Chase Points to equal the party size.</p>\n<hr />\n<h5>Gravel Slope</h5>\n<p><strong>Chase Points </strong>6; <strong>Overcome </strong>Acrobatics or Performance to balance while sliding down the slope, Survival to find the safest path down, ride a shield like a sled to get to safety (no check, requires wooden, steel, or tower shield that is not broken, reduces the shield's HP to its broken threshold)</p>\n<p>The players must slide down a treacherous gravel slope in order to escape Ashgut's nest.</p>\n<hr />\n<h5>Magma Crossing</h5>\n<p><strong>Chase Points </strong>6; <strong>Overcome </strong>Athletics to jump across the magma flows, Survival or Nature to identify the safest places to cross, spells or abilities with the cold or water trait to cool sections of magma for easier crossing (no check, cantrips won't work more than once)</p>\n<p>A series of magma flows impede the players' progress as they continue to run from Ashgut.</p>\n<hr />\n<h5><strong>Tight Tunnels</strong></h5>\n<p><strong>Chase Points </strong>6; <strong>Overcome </strong>Acrobatics to squeeze into tunnel sections too big for Ashgut, Deception to throw your voice and mislead Ashgut, Crafting to use junk as barricades to harry Ashgut's chase, spells or magic items with the illusion trait to trick Ashgut (no check, cantrips won't work more than once)</p>\n<p>The players descend into narrow tunnels as Ashgut scrambles to reach them.</p>\n<hr />\n<h5>Dark Labyrinth</h5>\n<p><strong>Chase Points </strong>6; <strong>Overcome </strong>Survival to navigate towards the exit, Thievery to search for hidden shortcuts, Occultism to ask local spirits for directions, spells, abilities, or items that create light and see the way (no check, the whole party can only gain a Chase Point from this once), use a compass to navigate (no check, the whole party can only gain a Chase Point from this once)</p>\n<p>Having accidentally stumbled into a dark labyrinth of caverns, the players must find a way out while Ashgut is still hot on their heels.</p>\n<hr />\n<h5>Nauseating Sulfur</h5>\n<p><strong>Chase Points </strong>6; <strong>Overcome </strong>Fortitude to overcome the smell, Crafting to assemble makeshift noseplugs, Athletics to run faster through the area, spells, abilities, or items that can dampen or nullify smells (no check, cantrips won't work more than once)</p>\n<p>The sickening smell of sulfur nauseates the players as they continue to run from Ashgut.</p>\n<hr />\n<h5>Leap of Faith</h5>\n<p><strong>Chase Points </strong>Special; <strong>Overcome </strong>Special</p>\n<p>The players come to the end of the cavern, which is significantly cooler than the rest of the cave network. A river runs through the cave, ending in a waterfall that empties into an outside lake below. With no other way to go, the players must jump into the lake. Instead of requiring Chase Points, each player must dive into the water, taking <strong style=\"font-family:var(--journal-serif);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">#Hazard 2-16 Complex Damage# </strong>with a <strong>#DC#</strong> basic Reflex save to minimize the damage they take from impact with the surface of the lake. Ashgut will remain at the top of the cliff, roaring in frustration, then leave the way she came.</p>\n<p>The Chase Sequence is the final encounter of the adventure. After completing the Chase Sequence, the GM should return the players to the outpost and conclude the adventure.</p>\n<h3>Recommended Locations</h3>\n<p>Caves, caverns, volcanic mountains, wastelands, plains, or  caverns. The Caligni's dwelling and the chase sequence can take place in the theater of the mind if necessary.</p>\n<h3>Recommended Creatures</h3>\n<p>Animals, beasts, elementals, dragons, drakes, giants, fire creatures, oozes, and any creatures that typically live in volcanic environments, such as reptiles, kobolds, and some types of fey.</p>\n<h3>Recommended Loot</h3>\n<p>The magma dragon egg should be worth 50% of the total treasure budget (paid as gp at the end of the adventure), with the other 50% coming from treasure and magic items related to fire, earth, metal, mountain survival gear, or volcanic environments.

Historians are doing their best to look for records of legendary dragons that might fit the creature's description, but aren't having any luck finding definitive information. Adventurers are tasked with exploring a nearby icy mountain - likely the home of the white dragon - to see if they can find any clues, as well as any resources that could help the outpost withstand the heat from the opposite dragon. The only way up the mountain is via vertical cliff face, so the adventurers should be prepared for a grueling climb.</p>\n<h3>Required Elements</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>The temperature condition for this mission is extreme cold, dealing <strong>#Hazard 2-16 Complex Damage#</strong> to the PCs every 10 minutes. If a PC has an ability that allows them to treat extreme cold as severe cold, they only take that damage every hour instead - this includes winter clothing. As a reminder, if the players spend four hours in the cold, they will become fatigued.</li>\n<li>The first encounter is a mountain climbing skill challenge, budgeted as 120 XP. The players will need to climb a sheer ice shelf in order to get closer to the dragon's lair, which is where the players will have the best luck finding clues about the white dragon. See the Mountain Climb section for more details.</li>\n<li>At any point after the mountain climb, there should be a tiny crevice broken into the side of the mountain, with an unnatural heat emanating through the attached 50-foot long dark tunnel. A medium or small creature can attempt to Squeeze through the tunnel by succeeding at a <strong>#DC#</strong> Acrobatics check, or a tiny creature can walk through it normally, and while in the tunnel, the interval at which that creature takes environmental temperature damage is paused and reset. At the end of the tunnel is a narrow shaft in the mountain that rises 20 feet, and can be climbed by succeeding at a <strong>#DC# </strong>Athletics check. Finally, at the top of the shaft lies a small opening in the ceiling covered by loose rocks. A successful <strong>#DC +2#</strong> Thievery check allows the creature to carefully remove the rocks from the opening and pull themselves up and outside, but a critical failure causes the shaft to cave in, causing the creature to take <strong>#Hazard 2-16 Simple Damage#</strong> and rendering the shaft unable to be further traversed. A creature who manages to successfully pull themselves up and outside the shaft sees a huge glacier surrounded by lava. The lava continually melts the glacier at its edges, but more ice continually expands from the middle of the glacier, creating an endless cycle. Carved into the side of the glacier facing the creature is a name in the Draconic alphabet: \"Fjordcarver.\"</li>\n<li>After the final encounter, the players find a magical chunk of ice that radiates an extremely cold aura - a successful <strong>#DC -2# </strong>Arcana or Nature check reveals that this is permafrost - magical ice that never melts - and would prove extremely valuable for countering the heat from the magma dragon.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Mountain Climb</h3>\n<p>The mountain climb is a cooperative skill challenge that involves the PCs working together to climb a mountain. Not all of the players will be proficient in Athletics, so cooperation will be vital for the ascent. If any players attempt to begin the adventure without climbing gear or winter clothing, the mission NPC should strongly encourage those players to purchase them from the general store.</p>\n<p>Before the climb begins, the party should form rope teams. Rope teams are composed of any number of climbers and a single belayer - the climbers make Athletics checks to climb, while the belayer uses a Fortitude save to act as a safeguard should any of the climbers begin to fall. More climbers in a rope team can allow a team to climb faster, but if any of the climbers fall, the entire rope team will be at risk of falling!</p>\n<p>Each round of climbing, every climber in a rope team attempts a <strong>#DC#</strong> Athletics check to climb. If there are multiple climbers in a rope team, use the worst rolled result for that rope team.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Success </strong>The rope team climbs 300 feet in 10 minutes, plus an additional 50 feet for each climber beyond the first.<br /><strong>Success </strong>The rope team climbs 250 feet in 10 minutes, plus an additional 25 feet for each climber beyond the first.<br /><strong>Failure </strong>The rope team climbs 125 feet in 10 minutes.<br /><strong>Critical Failure </strong>The rope team is in danger of falling! No progress is made, and the belayer must attempt a <strong>#DC#</strong> Fortitude save. On a success, the belayer is able to prevent the fall and the rope team can continue climbing as normal, but on a failure, the belayer is unable to prevent the fall and the rope team disbands. Any player in the rope team who has a climbing kit can attempt a DC 5 flat check as normal to arrest their fall: on a success, they stop falling and can continue climbing as normal, but on a failure (or if the player doesn't have a climbing kit), they fall, likely to their death, though items or spells such as snapleaves or feather fall may be able to save their life after falling some distance (determined by the GM). A rope team that has been disbanded due to a fall must be at the same elevation in order to reform a rope team, which may involve a player needing to climb solo to reach separated players.</p>\n<p>The cliff is 3,000 feet tall. Instead of tracking climbing by round, climbing is tracked in sets of 10 minutes. At 1,000 and 2,000 feet up the cliff, there are wide shelves where the players can rest and perform other exploration activities. Getting back down the mountain is much easier than climbing up - the players can repel down the mountain using the existing ropes, pullies, and pitons that they set into the mountain while climbing up. This doesn't require any checks, and can be handwaived at the end of the adventure.</p>\n<p>A climber who has a climb speed automatically succeeds at their checks to climb. If players to choose to fly up the cliff, the speed at which they fly will need to be calculated. A player with a fly speed of 40 feet could travel vertically at 20 feet per action (flying speed is halved when flying up), or 60 feet per round, or 600 feet per minute, so they could reach the top of the cliff in 5 minutes. Flying players aren't able to embed the belay system into the cliff as they fly up unless they cut their flying speed in half yet again (so a player with a fly speed of 40 would be flying up at a speed of 10 feet per action, 30 feet per round, and 300 feet per minute). If the belay system isn't embedded during the players' ascent, then climbing down the mountain will need to be played out, and the DCs are increased by +2 due to the increased difficulty when climbing down a mountain compared to climbing up. Other creative solutions may be allowed to assist with the ascent at the GM's discretion, but if the players aren't able to embed the belay system into the cliff, they will not be able to skip the climb down.</p>\n<h3>Recommended Locations</h3>\n<p>Snowy mountains, steppes, cliffs, or hills, frozen caves or caverns. The mountain climb will likely need to take place in the theater of the mind.</p>\n<h3>Recommended Creatures</h3>\n<p>Animals, beasts, elementals, dragons, drakes, giants, cold creatures, trolls, and any creatures that typically live in arctic environments, such as worms, some types of hags, and some types of fey.</p>\n<h3>Recommended Loot</h3>\n<p>The chunk of permafrost should be worth 50% of the total treasure budget (paid as gp at the end of the adventure), with the other 50% coming from treasure and magic items related to ice, earth, metal, mountain survival gear, or arctic environments. If the at least one player learns Fjordcarver's name from reading the Draconic carved into the glacier and see the enless cycle between the lava and the expanding glacier, they earn an Investigation Bonus in the form of raw gp equaling 10% of the total treasure budget.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"7RtLbrlfn9D7fL4K":3},"flags":{}}

If the gate is destroyed, the players should be informed that the cave is no longer viable for holding and they should prepare to Cause a Cave-In and escape, and the current encounter becomes infinite.</li>\n<li> During encounters, all players gain access to the Cause a Cave-In activity. By standing adjacent to a cave wall and spending one action, a player can attempt a <strong>#DC +2# </strong>Athletics or Survival check to reduce the structural integrity of the cave; on a success, they earn 1 Cave-In Point, or 2 on a critical success, with no points awarded for a failure or critical failure. Once 3 Cave-In Points have been obtained, the Cave-In begins, and players have two rounds to secure themselves behind the gate (or where the gate was located if it is now destroyed). Once all players have positioned themselves behind the gate, or once two rounds have passed, the cave collapses, dealing <strong>#Hazard 2-16 Simple Damage# </strong>to all creatures not behind the gate with a basic <strong>#Hazard 2-16 EDC# </strong>Reflex save (the gate does not take damage from the cave-in). Creatures that fail or critically fail their Reflex save are also buried beneath rubble, and begin suffocating. Rubble is impassible, but a 5-foot section of the rubble can be cleared by using two actions and succeeding at a <strong>#DC +2# </strong>Athletics or Survival check.</li>\n<li>An \"infinite\" encounter starts off like a moderate encounter, but once a creature is defeated, that creature is replaced by another creature. When an infinite encounter begins, the GM should warn the players that they can hear many more creatures coming down the cave. After the first creature is defeated and replaced, the GM should warn the players that the sounds of many more creatures coming down the cave is growing louder. After the second creature is defeated and replaced (and for all subsequent creatures defeated), the GM should warn the players that there seems to be no end to the approaching creatures.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Recommended Locations</h3>\n<p>Cave, cavern, mountain valley, mountain pass. Exterior locations should flavor the cave-in as an avalanche instead.</p>\n<h3>Recommended Creatures</h3>\n<p>Animals, beasts, fungi, elementals, drakes, giants, and any creatures that typically live in subterranean environments, such as xulgath, caligni, and drow. Any sapient creatures should be either uncooperatively territorial or mad with bloodlust.</p>\n<h3>Recommended Loot</h3>\n<p>The entirety of the treasure budget should be given out in raw GP, depending on how many encounters the players clear before they escape and whether or not they escape by causing a cave-in.</p>\n<table style=\"width:93.9759%\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:49.8218%\">Clearing an encounter</td>\n<td style=\"width:50.1782%\">25% of total treasure budget per encounter cleared</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:49.8218%\">Escaping by causing a cave-in</td>\n<td style=\"width:50.1782%\">\n<p>25% of total treasure budget</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:49.8218%\">The gate is still intact after causing a cave-in</td>\n<td style=\"width:50.1782%\">\n<p>10% of total treasure budget, and a flock of dead bird falls onto the safe side of the gate from the cave-in, though they don't appear to have any injuries.

If the players clear three encounters but do not cause a cave-in before escaping, they will only earn 75% of the total treasure budget (regardless of whether or not the gate is still intact).</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"7RtLbrlfn9D7fL4K":3},"flags":{}}
{"_id":"4RSt9ODgPk4YfMiU","name":"Gornlar Briefing","content":"<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>Gornlar was a nation composed of an unlikely alliance between several warlords cemented by a shared value: ambition. Not content with their simple lives as hunters and mercenaries, the peoples of these rocky hills banded together to create a legacy of strength and prestige for their descendents. At first, these new warlords fought between each other, but in the negotiations that followed, they realized that their combined power could create something greater.</p>\n<p>Their military might was unmatched on the western continent of Elleaterra. Gornlar's territory quickly expanded to cover the entire north side of their continent, kept in check only by the Ikougan navy and privateers. Their ambitions turned from that of expansion to conquest, and they were preparing to sail north in search of wealth to pillage, but were interrupted by a conquesting force from Verndhelt arriving suddenly on their shores. The Gornlarians fought valiantly, driving back Iron Empire, but not without significant casualties. Gornlar's ambitions changed once again: instead of leaving their lands to conquer others, they would build upon what their ancestors had already achieved.</p>\n<p>For generations, Gornlar remained peaceful. New freeholds were founded throughout the countryside and roads were built to connect them. Their society was insular to outsiders, receiving only the occasional merchant from Ikouga or Primrose, until ten years before the Cataclysm, when refugees from Taltain began to swarm Gornlar's shores en masse. The Taltainian refugees begged for the warriors of Gornlar to overthrow the island's ruling caste and liberate the common folk. The blood of their ancestral warlords boiled within them, and with little delay, Gornlar sent her armies to liberate Taltain.</p>\n<p>The liberation effort was successful, and Taltain joined the nation of Gornlar as a vassal state. Many of Gornlar's warriors chose to stay in the wealthy island nation of Taltain instead of returning home, leading to the freeholds being vastly underdefended when the Cataclysm struck and dragons razed Gornlar to the ground.</p>\n<p>For more information on Gornlar, see its entry in the <a href=\"https://scribe.pf2.tools/v/8vMfPSF7-covalon-player-s-guide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Covalon Player's Guide</a>.</p>\n<h2>Mission Overview</h2>\n<p>As the clockwork drill pierced through the final stretch of the mountains separating Covalon from Gornlar, a terrifying white dragon descended upon the vehicle. Kicking itself into overdrive, the drill sped for cover as fast as it could, narrowly avoiding the dragon's icy breath. It skidded on frozen ground, losing traction and slamming into a large rock, flipping it over. The rock then rose up high, revealing itself to be an ancient and furious magma dragon, which was the true subject of the white dragon's ire. The magma dragon shoved the drill aside, flipping it back onto its treads, then charged at the white dragon. The terrain shifted between ice and magma as the two dragons collided, and the drill - battered, bruised, and running low on operational time - bored into the side of a nearby cliff in a desperate attempt to find shelter from the battle. Pinned down in their cavernous refuge beneath a mountain that is half-volcanic and half-frozen, the Covalonians have decided to erect their base camp here, as further exploration is too dangerous as long as those two dragons roam the lands.</p>\n<h2>How to Run an Expedition</h2>\n<p>Expeditions are composed of two subtypes: missions and finales. Missions are a set of three dungeon-like adventures that are narratively linked, but can be completed in any order. Each mission must include predetermined narrative and mechanical elements while sticking to a theme of locations, creatures, and loot, which are included in its associated journal entry, with the specifics of the blanks to be filled in by the GM of the adventure. Like other adventure types, Dungeon Guides must submit their expedition missions for approval.</p>\n<p>When reading the instructions for an expedition, you may see key terms surrounded by number signs. These indicate that the term should be replaced by a value that's dependent on the adventure's average party level.  If you have any questions about how to apply these terms or any of the required elements, be sure to ask about them during your submission for approval. Here is a list of terms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>#Creature [Table Number] [Modifier]#</strong> should be replaced by a value according to a table in the <a href=\"https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=995\">Building Creatures</a> section of the Gamemastery Guide. For example, \"#Creature 2-8 Minimum# means that you should reference the Building Creatures rules, look for Table 2-8, and use the value in the Minimum column for the creature's level (adjusted for elite or weak as appropriate).</li>\n<li><strong>#Hazard [Table Number] [Modifier]# </strong>should be replaced by a value according to a table in the <a href=\"https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=1043\">Building Hazards</a> section of the Gamemastery Guide. For example, \"#Hazard 2-16 Simple Damage# means that you should reference the Building Hazards rules, look for table 2-16, and use the value in the Simple Damage column for the hazard's level.</li>\n<li><strong>#DC [Modifier]# </strong>should be replaced by a value according to the <a href=\"https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=554\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DCs by Level</a> table in the Core Rulebook. If a modifier is included, the value should be adjusted accordingly. For example, \"#DC +5#\" means that you should reference the DCs by Level table, find the value appropriate for the party's average level, then add 5 to it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Finales are singular encounters against a narratively significant threat that conclude an expedition. They come in two versions: normal mode and hard mode. Before a finale is cleared for the first time, it can only be run by Covalon administrators and moderators, and is ran at hard mode. Afterwards, the finale can be ran by any Dungeon Guide at normal mode (though players can request hard mode if they'd like). Normal mode can be run in Tier 2 or above, and hard mode can only be run at the highest tier, intended for max level characters. Unlike missions, finales use a specific map and specific creatures, included with this module.</p>\n<p>Each finale comes with three variant modifications. When running a normal mode finale, a GM choose one of the three modifications to use, or can roll [[/r 1d3]] to randomly determine which modification to use. When running a hard mode finale, the GM uses all three modifications. There are no additional rewards for completing hard mode.</p>\n<h2>Reporting a Completed Expedition</h2>\n<p>When reporting a completed expedition in the Dungeon Summaries channel, use the <strong>exact name</strong> of the adventure as the adventure's title. For example, if you ran the first mission of Ikouga, the summary's title should be \"Ikouga Mission A: Retame the Island\" exactly. The summary should otherwise follow the same format as dungeons.</p>\n<p>Finally, any narrative-based knowledge or intrigue that the players gain as a result of the expedition should be left out of the summary. For example, if the players complete a bonus objective that allows them to learn special information as detailed in the Required Elements or Recommended Loot section of each journal entry, that should be left out of the dungeon summary.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"7RtLbrlfn9D7fL4K":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.covalon-expeditions.covalon-expeditions-gornlar.4RSt9ODgPk4YfMiU"}}}
{"_id":"Pkit9W2Ook6HqwEG","name":"Gornlar Finale","content":"<h2>Gornlar Finale: Ashgut and Fjordcarver</h2>\n<h3>Hook</h3>\n<p>In the mountains south of Gornlar, the Covalon adventurers discovered that a pair of legendary dragons had been roused from hibernation by the Cataclysm, partaking in the power of the Maw in order to cause untold destruction to the surrounding lands. Though Ashgut and Fjordcarver were defeated and a Vessel was destroyed, the Maw refuses to take this loss lying down. Another pair of dragons has been spotted heading for the transplanted Seed of Terra sapling - and they look eerily similar to dragons that were recently felled.</p>\n<h3>Battle in the Dichotomous Valley</h3>\n<p>In an attempt to regain lost ground, the Maw has created facsimiles of both Ashgut and Fjordcarver and has sent them barreling towards the transplanted Seed of Terra. Covalon's tacticians have determined that the valley half-covered in frost and half-covered in flame will serve as the best place to intercept them, and once again, both dragons will need to be fought at the same time in order to use their conflicting energies against them.</p>\n<p>The PCs begin in the middle of the map, with Ashgut starting at the west end of the valley and Fjordcarver starting at the east end. Generally speaking, Ashgut and Fjordcarver prefer to utilize their long range rather than move, but they can move if they need to maneuver around conjured objects, effects, or anything that would significantly hinder them. Although Ashgut can climb up the sides of the valley and Fjordcarver can fly high into the air, they generally should not do this as it would create a negative play experience for the players, especially since this encounter is designed to take place on the ground.</p>\n<p>If the GM has not done so yet, they should select one of the three Modifications to apply (found in both Ashgut and Fjordcarver's statblocks), or roll [[/r 1d3]] to determine one randomly. Do not tell the players which Modification is in effect. (For Hard Mode, use all 3 modifications.) Note: The same modification must be chosen for both Ashgut and Fjordcarver; they cannot have different modifications.</p>\n<p>Though not shown on the map, if the PCs need to escape from the encounter, they can do so by running through a tunnel in the southern wall at the middle of the map. This tunnel should not be used for fighting though, as the dragons' special abilities will make quick work of any party foolish enough to entrench themselves there.</p>\n<h3>Tactics Overview</h3>\n<p>Ashgut and Fjordcarver are both immensely powerful on their own, but their signature abilities conflict with each other, giving the PCs an advantage by battling both of the dragons simultaneously. The main gimmick of the encounter is <strong>Flash Freeze </strong>and <strong>Landwaster</strong>. At the end of her first turn, Ashgut will begin charging Landwaster, firing it off at the beginning of her next turn and dealing immense damage to anyone in contact with the ground or a wall in the arena. But before Ashgut can finish using Landwaster, Fjordcarver will use Flash Freeze, which \"accidentally\" creates icicles that reduce the damage dealt by Landwaster as long as a PC is adjacent to one when Landwaster's damage occurs. (Fjordcarver's <strong>Jealousy</strong> ability ensures that he always moves after Ashgut, regardless of initiative results or delays.) The icicles are then destroyed, which prevents the arena from being flooded with obstacles. Without Flash Freeze, Ashgut's Landwaster would deal incredible amounts of damage that would quickly overwhelm the players, while without Landwaster, Fjordcarver's Flash Freeze would eventually fill the entire arena with icicles, preventing players from dodging them and forcing them to be impaled.</p>\n<p>Players may consider using flight to avoid these powerful attacks, but Ashgut's <strong>Sulfuric Skies </strong>and Fjordcarver's <strong>Localized Blizzard </strong>make flight a risky prospect. These abilities impose powerful penalties and adverse conditions on flying players, but have no effect against players on the ground or players who are climbing (though climbing does not make a player safe from Flash Freeze or Landwaster).</p>\n<p>Ahsgut and Fjordcarver's presences are so strong that they affect the very terrain around them. <strong>Molten Fields </strong>and <strong>Frozen Fields </strong>impose elemental weaknesses on the PCs that allow the dragons to deal more damage, and during the <strong>Modification - Ley Line Intersection </strong>modification, players may need to swap back and forth between the two fields in order to manage their weakness stacks. If <strong>Modification - Clinging Energy </strong>is in play, the PCs may also need to routinely swap sides so they can clear their persistent damage and avoid taking bonus damage from their elemental weakness.</p>\n<p>Due to the interaction of Flash Freeze and Landwaster, players are incentivized to try to kill both dragons at the same time. This should generally be the most effective strategy, but <strong>Modification - Rapturous Rivalry </strong>can throw a wrench in this by giving one of the dragons a significant heal when their rival dies. </p>\n<p>Ashgut and Fjordcarver should be content to remain at their opposite ends of the arena, using their ranged <strong>Spit Magma </strong>and <strong>Spit Ice </strong>strikes<strong>, Breath Weapon</strong>, and <strong>Burning Stare </strong>or <strong>Frosty Gaze </strong>to hit PCs that aren't in range of their melee strikes. Though GMs may be tempted to use the Breath Weapons each round, it has lower damage than a normal dragon's Breath Weapon, and it may not put as much pressure on the players as focusing on downing a single PC would.</p>\n<h3>Superdragon Superbowl!</h3>\n<p>The Maw has changed its tactics after the defeat of its Facsimiles! It has created alternate versions of the original Fjordcarver and Ashgut with modified abilities. The new pairings should be run in the following pairs:</p>\n<table style=\"width:45.4015%\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:51.3605%\"><strong>Ashgut</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width:48.6395%\"><strong>Fjordcarver</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:51.3605%\">Blue Ashgut</td>\n<td style=\"width:48.6395%\">Crystal Fjordcarver</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:51.3605%\">Umbral Ashgut</td>\n<td style=\"width:48.6395%\">Sovereign Fjordcarver</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:51.3605%\">Brine Ashgut</td>\n<td style=\"width:48.6395%\">Sea Fjordcarver</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Loot</h3>\n<p>The entirety of the treasure budget is given out in raw GP, paid by the NPC used for the hook.

Historians are doing their best to look for records of legendary dragons that might fit the creature's description, but aren't having any luck finding definitive information. Adventurers are tasked with exploring a nearby fiery mountain - likely the home of the magma dragon - to see if they can find any clues, as well as any resources that could help the outpost withstand the cold from the opposite dragon. This is a reconnaissance mission - if the adventurers encounter the magma dragon, they are advised to run away instead of engaging.</p>\n<h3>Required Elements</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>The temperature condition for this mission is extreme heat, dealing <strong>#Hazard 2-16 Complex Damage#</strong> to the PCs every 10 minutes. If a PC has an ability that allows them to extreme heat as severe heat, they only take that damage every hour instead.</li>\n<li>The final encounter should be a chase sequence, budgeted as 120 XP. The players will unknowingly approach Ashgut's nest, and find a sizeable stone on an ornate dias that glows red and gleams when light hits it - a successful <strong>#DC -2# </strong>Arcana or Nature check to Recall Knowledge reveals that this is a magma dragon egg, equally as dangerous as it is valuable, radiating a constant heat that could help in counter the cold from the white dragon (though the examination also reveals that the egg is non-viable). If the players decide to take it, Ashgut erupts into the area shortly after, beginning the chase sequence. See the Chase Sequence section for more details.</li>\n<li style=\"padding-left:var(--space-s)\">At any point before the chase sequence, there should be an illusory wall somewhere in the adventure which can be disbelieved by a character that interacts with it and succeeds at a <strong>#DC +2# </strong>Will save (a character taking the Search exploration activity is considered to be interacting with it). Beyond the illusory wall lies a chamber covered by a 4th-level <em style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em)\">darkness</em> spell. If the PCs enter the chamber, they are hailed by an old man who introduces himself as a displaced Caligni (N male caligni wizard). The caligni's attitude towards the PCs starts off as neutral, be he welcomes them into his home and offers them water, encouraging them to rest and take a break from the heat in his cool-temperature home, which pauses and resets the temperature damage interval (the PCs likely won't have greater darkvision, but can feel around for furniture to sit on). The Caligni is hesitant to talk about certain topics, but the PCs can obtain information about the magma dragon from him if they make a successful <strong style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em)\">#DC +2# </strong>Diplomacy check to Request or Intimidation check to Coerce. (Players can also make <strong style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em)\">#DC</strong><strong style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em)\">#</strong> Diplomacy checks to Make an Impression on him and improve his attitude towards them, which adjusts the Request/Coerce DCs as normal.) On a success, the Caligni tells them that the magma dragon is a legendary creature who has lived for hundreds of years and goes by the name of Ashgut. In the past, she had a violent rivalry with a white dragon that ended up with the two of them being too wounded to continue fighting, and has since been living quietly in the volcano - until recently when she suddenly became violent and active again, scattering the Caligni's tribe to different corners of the mountain. On a critical success, he remembers that the injury Ashgut sustained was to her wings, and she can no longer fly as a result. If the players use a light spell to counteract the 4th-level <em style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em)\">darkness</em> inside the Caligni's home, or if they use <em style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em)\">dispel magic</em> or some other type of ability to remove the darkness, the Caligni's attitude immediately turns hostile, and he demands the players leave him immediately. If he is attacked, he will defend himself, using the stats for a @Compendium[pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary-3.zdJgaVe6VRSfEE1n]{Caligni Caller}.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Chase Sequence</h3>\n<p>When the chase sequence begins, all players roll Perception for initiative - this determines how quickly they react to the event and the order in which they'll be attempting to escape from Ashgut, who is placed at the end of initiative. On each of Ashgut's turns, she rains down molten fury on the players with her powerful breath weapon, dealing <strong>#Hazard 2-16 Complex Damage#</strong> damage with a <strong>#Hazard 2-16 HDC# </strong>basic Reflex save. Half the damage is fire, and half is bludgeoning.</p>\n<p>The players must overcome a series of Obstacles in order to escape from Ashgut. On their turn, a player can attempt a check to Overcome the current Obstacle and earn Chase Points for their party.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Success </strong>The party gains 2 Chase Points.<br /><strong>Success</strong> The party gains 1 Chase Point.<br /><strong>Critical Failure </strong>The party loses 1 Chase Point.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, instead of making a check to Overcome the Obstacle, a player can gain three actions as normal that they can use to support their fellow party members. A player might even have a spell or ability that allows them to succeed at Overcoming the Obstacle without even needing to make a check, at the GM's discretion. Players cannot Delay during the chase, nor can they attack Ashgut; the heat of her flames are much too intense to allow anyone to get close, even with protective magic.</p>\n<p>Once enough Chase Points have been achieved to clear an Obstacle, the entire party moves onto the next Obstacle. Chase Points do not carry over between Obstacles. Use <strong>#DC# </strong>for the DC of all checks to overcome obstacles. Each Obstacle requires a number of Chase Points to clear based on the size of the party; if there are less than 6 players in the party, reduce the amount of required Chase Points to equal the party size.</p>\n<hr />\n<h5>Gravel Slope</h5>\n<p><strong>Chase Points </strong>6; <strong>Overcome </strong>Acrobatics or Performance to balance while sliding down the slope, Survival to find the safest path down, ride a shield like a sled to get to safety (no check, requires wooden, steel, or tower shield that is not broken, reduces the shield's HP to its broken threshold)</p>\n<p>The players must slide down a treacherous gravel slope in order to escape Ashgut's nest.</p>\n<hr />\n<h5>Magma Crossing</h5>\n<p><strong>Chase Points </strong>6; <strong>Overcome </strong>Athletics to jump across the magma flows, Survival or Nature to identify the safest places to cross, spells or abilities with the cold or water trait to cool sections of magma for easier crossing (no check, cantrips won't work more than once)</p>\n<p>A series of magma flows impede the players' progress as they continue to run from Ashgut.</p>\n<hr />\n<h5><strong>Tight Tunnels</strong></h5>\n<p><strong>Chase Points </strong>6; <strong>Overcome </strong>Acrobatics to squeeze into tunnel sections too big for Ashgut, Deception to throw your voice and mislead Ashgut, Crafting to use junk as barricades to harry Ashgut's chase, spells or magic items with the illusion trait to trick Ashgut (no check, cantrips won't work more than once)</p>\n<p>The players descend into narrow tunnels as Ashgut scrambles to reach them.</p>\n<hr />\n<h5>Dark Labyrinth</h5>\n<p><strong>Chase Points </strong>6; <strong>Overcome </strong>Survival to navigate towards the exit, Thievery to search for hidden shortcuts, Occultism to ask local spirits for directions, spells, abilities, or items that create light and see the way (no check, the whole party can only gain a Chase Point from this once), use a compass to navigate (no check, the whole party can only gain a Chase Point from this once)</p>\n<p>Having accidentally stumbled into a dark labyrinth of caverns, the players must find a way out while Ashgut is still hot on their heels.</p>\n<hr />\n<h5>Nauseating Sulfur</h5>\n<p><strong>Chase Points </strong>6; <strong>Overcome </strong>Fortitude to overcome the smell, Crafting to assemble makeshift noseplugs, Athletics to run faster through the area, spells, abilities, or items that can dampen or nullify smells (no check, cantrips won't work more than once)</p>\n<p>The sickening smell of sulfur nauseates the players as they continue to run from Ashgut.</p>\n<hr />\n<h5>Leap of Faith</h5>\n<p><strong>Chase Points </strong>Special; <strong>Overcome </strong>Special</p>\n<p>The players come to the end of the cavern, which is significantly cooler than the rest of the cave network. A river runs through the cave, ending in a waterfall that empties into an outside lake below. With no other way to go, the players must jump into the lake. Instead of requiring Chase Points, each player must dive into the water, taking <strong style=\"font-family:var(--journal-serif);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">#Hazard 2-16 Complex Damage# </strong>with a <strong>#DC#</strong> basic Reflex save to minimize the damage they take from impact with the surface of the lake.

If any players attempt to begin the adventure without climbing gear or winter clothing, the mission NPC should strongly encourage those players to purchase them from the general store.</p>\n<p>Before the climb begins, the party should form rope teams. Rope teams are composed of any number of climbers and a single belayer - the climbers make Athletics checks to climb, while the belayer uses a Fortitude save to act as a safeguard should any of the climbers begin to fall. More climbers in a rope team can allow a team to climb faster, but if any of the climbers fall, the entire rope team will be at risk of falling!</p>\n<p>Each round of climbing, every climber in a rope team attempts a <strong>#DC#</strong> Athletics check to climb. If there are multiple climbers in a rope team, use the worst rolled result for that rope team.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Success </strong>The rope team climbs 300 feet in 10 minutes, plus an additional 50 feet for each climber beyond the first.<br /><strong>Success </strong>The rope team climbs 250 feet in 10 minutes, plus an additional 25 feet for each climber beyond the first.<br /><strong>Failure </strong>The rope team climbs 125 feet in 10 minutes.<br /><strong>Critical Failure </strong>The rope team is in danger of falling! No progress is made, and the belayer must attempt a <strong>#DC#</strong> Fortitude save. On a success, the belayer is able to prevent the fall and the rope team can continue climbing as normal, but on a failure, the belayer is unable to prevent the fall and the rope team disbands. Any player in the rope team who has a climbing kit can attempt a DC 5 flat check as normal to arrest their fall: on a success, they stop falling and can continue climbing as normal, but on a failure (or if the player doesn't have a climbing kit), they fall, likely to their death, though items or spells such as snapleaves or feather fall may be able to save their life after falling some distance (determined by the GM). A rope team that has been disbanded due to a fall must be at the same elevation in order to reform a rope team, which may involve a player needing to climb solo to reach separated players.</p>\n<p>The cliff is 3,000 feet tall. Instead of tracking climbing by round, climbing is tracked in sets of 10 minutes. At 1,000 and 2,000 feet up the cliff, there are wide shelves where the players can rest and perform other exploration activities. Getting back down the mountain is much easier than climbing up - the players can repel down the mountain using the existing ropes, pullies, and pitons that they set into the mountain while climbing up. This doesn't require any checks, and can be handwaived at the end of the adventure.</p>\n<p>A climber who has a climb speed automatically succeeds at their checks to climb. If players to choose to fly up the cliff, the speed at which they fly will need to be calculated. A player with a fly speed of 40 feet could travel vertically at 20 feet per action (flying speed is halved when flying up), or 60 feet per round, or 600 feet per minute, so they could reach the top of the cliff in 5 minutes. Flying players aren't able to embed the belay system into the cliff as they fly up unless they cut their flying speed in half yet again (so a player with a fly speed of 40 would be flying up at a speed of 10 feet per action, 30 feet per round, and 300 feet per minute). If the belay system isn't embedded during the players' ascent, then climbing down the mountain will need to be played out, and the DCs are increased by +2 due to the increased difficulty when climbing down a mountain compared to climbing up. Other creative solutions may be allowed to assist with the ascent at the GM's discretion, but if the players aren't able to embed the belay system into the cliff, they will not be able to skip the climb down.</p>\n<h3>Recommended Locations</h3>\n<p>Snowy mountains, steppes, cliffs, or hills, frozen caves or caverns. The mountain climb will likely need to take place in the theater of the mind.</p>\n<h3>Recommended Creatures</h3>\n<p>Animals, beasts, elementals, dragons, drakes, giants, cold creatures, trolls, and any creatures that typically live in arctic environments, such as worms, some types of hags, and some types of fey.</p>\n<h3>Recommended Loot</h3>\n<p>The chunk of permafrost should be worth 50% of the total treasure budget (paid as gp at the end of the adventure), with the other 50% coming from treasure and magic items related to ice, earth, metal, mountain survival gear, or arctic environments. If the at least one player learns Fjordcarver's name from reading the Draconic carved into the glacier and see the enless cycle between the lava and the expanding glacier, they earn an Investigation Bonus in the form of raw gp equaling 10% of the total treasure budget.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"7RtLbrlfn9D7fL4K":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.covalon-expeditions.covalon-expeditions-gornlar.xRMyK31P5a1KeQkY"}}}
{"_id":"xtLOdXtNnint2kie","name":"Gornlar Mission A: Secure the Caves","content":"<h3>Hook</h3>\n<p>The cliff face that the drill bored into revealed an entry way into an extensive cave system. These caves can be used to allow adventurers to move throughout the mountains undetected by the dragons, but they'll need to be secured from any creatures coming the other way in order to keep base camp hidden and safe. Adventurers are tasked with guarding one of the many cave checkpoints from aggressive creatures. If the checkpoint becomes too dangerous to guard, the adventurers are instructed to cause a cave-in before escaping.</p>\n<h3>Required Elements</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>This adventure takes place on a single battlemap and features several waves of enemies - three moderate encounters of creatures with a 10 minute break in between each, followed by a fourth, infinite encounter.</li>\n<li>Players must protect a gate from the aggressive creatures during the encounter. The gate has <strong>#Creature 2-7 Low Maximum# </strong>hit points. Strikes against it automatically succeed and it automatically fails its saving throw against damaging effects. It is immune to critical hits and has object immunities. It can be repaired by using the Repair exploration activity with a DC of <strong>#DC#</strong>. If the gate is destroyed, the players should be informed that the cave is no longer viable for holding and they should prepare to Cause a Cave-In and escape, and the current encounter becomes infinite.</li>\n<li> During encounters, all players gain access to the Cause a Cave-In activity. By standing adjacent to a cave wall and spending one action, a player can attempt a <strong>#DC +2# </strong>Athletics or Survival check to reduce the structural integrity of the cave; on a success, they earn 1 Cave-In Point, or 2 on a critical success, with no points awarded for a failure or critical failure. Once 3 Cave-In Points have been obtained, the Cave-In begins, and players have two rounds to secure themselves behind the gate (or where the gate was located if it is now destroyed). Once all players have positioned themselves behind the gate, or once two rounds have passed, the cave collapses, dealing <strong>#Hazard 2-16 Simple Damage# </strong>to all creatures not behind the gate with a basic <strong>#Hazard 2-16 EDC# </strong>Reflex save (the gate does not take damage from the cave-in). Creatures that fail or critically fail their Reflex save are also buried beneath rubble, and begin suffocating. Rubble is impassible, but a 5-foot section of the rubble can be cleared by using two actions and succeeding at a <strong>#DC +2# </strong>Athletics or Survival check.</li>\n<li>An \"infinite\" encounter starts off like a moderate encounter, but once a creature is defeated, that creature is replaced by another creature. When an infinite encounter begins, the GM should warn the players that they can hear many more creatures coming down the cave. After the first creature is defeated and replaced, the GM should warn the players that the sounds of many more creatures coming down the cave is growing louder. After the second creature is defeated and replaced (and for all subsequent creatures defeated), the GM should warn the players that there seems to be no end to the approaching creatures.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Recommended Locations</h3>\n<p>Cave, cavern, mountain valley, mountain pass. Exterior locations should flavor the cave-in as an avalanche instead.</p>\n<h3>Recommended Creatures</h3>\n<p>Animals, beasts, fungi, elementals, drakes, giants, and any creatures that typically live in subterranean environments, such as xulgath, caligni, and drow. Any sapient creatures should be either uncooperatively territorial or mad with bloodlust.</p>\n<h3>Recommended Loot</h3>\n<p>The entirety of the treasure budget should be given out in raw GP, depending on how many encounters the players clear before they escape and whether or not they escape by causing a cave-in.</p>\n<table style=\"width:93.9759%\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:49.8218%\">Clearing an encounter</td>\n<td style=\"width:50.1782%\">25% of total treasure budget per encounter cleared</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:49.8218%\">Escaping by causing a cave-in</td>\n<td style=\"width:50.1782%\">\n<p>25% of total treasure budget</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:49.8218%\">The gate is still intact after causing a cave-in</td>\n<td style=\"width:50.1782%\">\n<p>10% of total treasure budget, and a flock of dead bird falls onto the safe side of the gate from the cave-in, though they don't appear to have any injuries. A <strong>#DC#</strong> Medicine check reveals that these birds died from both smoke suffocation and freezing to death simultaneously.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>For example, if the players clear all three encounters (the fourth cannot be cleared because it is infinite), escape by causing a cave-in, and the gate is still intact, the players earn 110% of the total treasure budget. If the players clear three encounters but do not cause a cave-in before escaping, they will only earn 75% of the total treasure budget (regardless of whether or not the gate is still intact).</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"7RtLbrlfn9D7fL4K":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.covalon-expeditions.covalon-expeditions-gornlar.xtLOdXtNnint2kie"}}}
